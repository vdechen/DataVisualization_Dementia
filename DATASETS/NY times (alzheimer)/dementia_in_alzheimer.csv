Common difficulties include: • Word- or name-finding problems noticeable to family or close associates • Decreased ability to remember names when introduced to new people • Performance issues in social or work settings noticeable to family, friends or co-workers • Reading a passage and retaining little material • Losing or misplacing a valuable object • Decline in ability to plan or organize Stage 4: Moderate cognitive decline At this stage, a careful medical interview detects clear-cut deficiencies in the following areas: • Decreased knowledge of recent occasions or current events • Impaired ability to perform challenging mental arithmetic-for example, to count backward from 100 by 7s • Decreased capacity to perform complex tasks, such as marketing, planning dinner for guests or paying bills and managing finances • Reduced memory of personal history • The affected individual may seem subdued and withdrawn, especially in socially or mentally challenging situations Stage 5: Moderately severe cognitive decline Major gaps in memory and deficits in cognitive function emerge. Some assistance with day-to-day activities becomes essential. At this stage, individuals may: • Be unable during a medical interview to recall such important details as their current address, their telephone number or the name of the college or high school from which they graduated • Become confused about where they are or about the date, day of the week, or season • Have trouble with less challenging mental arithmetic; for example, counting backward from 40 by 4s or from 20 by 2s • Need help choosing proper clothing for the season or the occasion • Usually retain substantial knowledge about themselves and know their own name and the names of their spouse or children • Usually require no assistance with eating or using the toilet Stage 6: Severe cognitive decline Memory difficulties continue to worsen, significant personality changes may emerge and affected individuals need extensive help with customary daily activities. At this stage, individuals may: • Lose most awareness of recent experiences and events as well as of their surroundings • Recollect their personal history imperfectly, although they generally recall their own name • Occasionally forget the name of their spouse or primary caregiver but generally can distinguish familiar from unfamiliar faces • Need help getting dressed properly; without supervision, may make such errors as putting pajamas over daytime clothes or shoes on wrong feet • Experience disruption of their normal sleep/waking cycle • Need help with handling details of toileting (flushing toilet, wiping and disposing of tissue properly) • Have increasing episodes of urinary or fecal incontinence • Experience significant personality changes and behavioral symptoms, including suspiciousness and delusions (for example, believing that their caregiver is an impostor); hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not really there); or compulsive, repetitive behaviors such as hand-wringing or tissue shredding • Tend to wander and become lost Stage 7: Very severe cognitive decline This is the final stage of the disease when individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, the ability to speak and, ultimately, the ability to control movement. • Frequently individuals lose their capacity for recognizable speech, although words or phrases may occasionally be uttered • Individuals need help with eating and toileting and there is general incontinence of urine • Individuals lose the ability to walk without assistance, then the ability to sit without support, the ability to smile, and the ability to hold their head up. Reflexes become abnormal and muscles grow rigid. Swallowing is impaired. ","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': ""Alzheimer's Disease"", 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]"

It's long been known that social relationships can decrease the risk of developing dementia. In June, Harvard researchers reported how active socializing in old age could delay memory problems.   But most research on social relationships and dementia measures the social life of the very old. The newest study, presented at the 2008 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease in Chicago, focused on the effect relationships in midlife may have on long-term risk. It tracked 2,000 men and women in Finland beginning at the age of 50 and followed up with them 21 years later.   They found that people who were living with a spouse or a partner in midlife ran a 50 percent lower risk of developing dementia during their older years than people living alone. How long a person had been single and the reason they were single also affected risk. Living alone for your entire adult life doubled risk, but those who had been married and then divorced and remained single in midlife showed three times the risk.  Those at greatest risk of developing dementia were people who had lost their partner before middle age and then continued to live as a widow or widower. The study showed that these individuals had a six times greater chance of developing Alzheimer's than those who were married.  ""This suggests two influencing factors -- social and intellectual stimulation and trauma,"" said lead author Krister Håkansson, a psychology researcher at Växjö University and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. ""In practice, it shows how important it is to put resources into helping people who have undergone a crisis.""  Dr. Håkansson said future research will focus on whether risk is influenced by the quality of the relationship or whether someone always intended to live a single life or not. ",[]

117,Alzheimer,2008,The New York Times,Guide to Assisted Living,10 Things to Know About Assisted Living,"Dr. Cheryl Woodson, an experienced geriatrician, offers some advice on navigating the caregiving maze.","Dr. Cheryl Woodson, you may recall from last week's post, is a seasoned geriatrician in Chicago Heights, Ill., who has found that she can no longer afford to accept new Medicare patients.   She is also a blunt and funny woman who liberally dispenses wisdom to her elderly patients and their adult children, and herself a daughter who cared for her own mother with Alzheimer's disease for a decade. Here's some of Dr. Woodson's advice on navigating the caregiving maze, which I culled both from her book, ""To Survive Caregiving,"" and from observing her during a recent day-long visit to her office.   (Photo: Dr. Cheryl Woodson, geriatrician and author of ""To Survive Caregiving."" (Sally Ryan for The New York Times))   1. Assisted living, a popular solution for elderly people who cannot live independently, is a ""myth,"" Dr. Woodson said, ""a place for people who don't exist."" Families often believe these facilities will meet all of their loved ones' needs, enabling caregivers to focus on jobs and family, only to find this isn't the case. Before long, the elderly resident will require more than ""meals you don't have to cook, grass you don't have to cut and socialization,'' Dr. Woodson said. At that point the elderly resident is in trouble, since assisted living facilities are not permitted by law to provide medical care and consider it to be the family's responsibility.   2. Squaring a family's expectations with those legal limits would require a thorough, first-hand assessment of the elderly person's physical and cognitive health before admission to an assisted living facility. That rarely happens. New residents are admitted based on a report from their current physicians, who may not be qualified to diagnose the early signs of dementia and impending immobility or may sugarcoat the situation in order to help a desperate family. ""They just need a little help,'' the usual rationale for accepting elderly prospects into assisted living, is ridiculous on its face, Dr. Woodson said. ""If they just needed a little help, they'd still be in the community.""   3. Instead, without verifying the physician's report or the family's representations, these facilities may admit residents who already need help with simple tasks like dressing or eating, or will in the very near future, and then charge extra for these services. Some do this to fill empty beds; others give residency a shot as a kindness to desperate families, Dr. Woodson said. But when the resident declines, as all of them will unless they die suddenly, more and more a la carte services mean a bigger and bigger monthly bill, or more and more work for family members who expected the opposite.  4. Coordinating all the services that the assisted living facility doesn't provide generally falls to one sibling, Dr. Woodson noted, who then becomes overwhelmed, sacrificing more than should be expected. The solution is hiring a geriatric care manager -- ""They should be called rent-a-daughters,'' Dr. Woodson said -- adding further to the expense, until the resident and family can no longer afford this kind of accommodation and are forced to consider a nursing home.  5. Most families balk at the prospect of transferring an aging parent to a nursing home because they like the aesthetics of assisted living -- the carpeted floors, overstuffed chairs and crystal chandeliers. But without round-the-clock care, many residents are ""as alone at night as if they were in their own homes,'' Dr. Woodson said. Other families are unwilling to break a promise to Mom or Dad never to put them in a nursing home. The spirit of that promise -- to give a parent the best possible care -- is what matters, Dr. Woodson said, ""and sometimes that means not doing it yourself.'' An aging parent's condition may eventually require three shifts of nurses and aides, not a family member trying to take care of everything 24/7.  6. The doctors who see residents at assisted living facilities are essentially freelancers, not employees, since their fees are paid by Medicare and they also may maintain private practices. So rather than hang around the facility expecting them to answer your questions on the fly, Dr. Woodson suggested calling and arranging to see them ""by appointment, not by ambush.'' This consultation will not be covered by Medicare unless it coincides with a medical procedure for the resident. Still, it is essential in order to stay on top of an elderly person's medications, some of which may be unnecessary and even dangerous, and to make decisions about which medical care improves the quality of life and which is pointless and wasteful.  7. If a parent lives in an assisted living facility, families should closely monitor the monthly pharmacy bill, less for cost than for content. Is Xanax being prescribed for anxiety? There are numerous other remedies available without the potentially dangerous side effects. What about muscle relaxants for arthritic pain? They increase confusion in the elderly and add to the risk of falls; instead, ask for pain medication and/or a heating pad. If the assisted living facility offers to have prescriptions filled and delivered by a local pharmacy -- a huge convenience for family members -- be sure it's a pharmacy that insists upon periodic blood work or other tests for drugs that are supposed to be closely monitored.  8. The goal of medical care for the elderly, in Dr. Woodson's view and the view of every geriatrician I've ever interviewed, is to make day-to-day life more comfortable, not to cure illness or extend longevity. Examples? A joint replacement to relieve pain and improve mobility makes sense only if the patient has the cognitive ability to complete physical therapy. Otherwise, he or she will never walk again and would be better off avoiding surgery and simply being kept comfortable. Similarly, anyone who would refuse cancer treatment because of advanced age probably doesn't need a mammogram, Pap smear or colonoscopy. ""Why draw a map to someplace we know we're not going?'' Dr. Woodson asked.  9. Apply similar standards to immunizations and vaccinations. If someone is so ill or disabled that death would be welcome, refuse the vaccine for pneumonia, long known as ""the old person's friend.'' But never say no to the shingles vaccine, which can prevent an excruciating rash. ""Even if someone was only going to live five more minutes, that's the one thing I'd suggest,'' Dr. Woodson says. ""It's a quality-of-life issue.''  10. Do not assume that the presenting symptom of Alzheimer's disease will be forgetting words, losing things or other obvious examples of short-term memory loss. Often the first thing a family member will notice is an empty checking account, Dr. Woodson said, because a normally cautious and frugal person has been tricked by a get-rich-quick scheme or other scam. And like missing money, look out for pills missing from those seven-day dispensers that help people with multiple medications keep track of what they're taking and when. Family members may find the dispensers empty and worry about overdose, Dr. Woodson noted, but often the missing pills will turn up under couch cushions or scattered elsewhere around the house. Take this as a cue that it may be time for a cognitive assessment. ",[]
142,Alzheimer,2008,The New York Times,Advice on End-of-Life Care,What an End-of-Life Adviser Could Have Told Me,Advice on end-of-life care that could have eased my mother’s last days.,"(Photo: Jane Gross's mother, Estelle Gross, at a nursing home in Riverdale, N.Y., in 2002.)   If only I'd had the 800 number for Compassion & Choices in the last difficult months of my mother's life. She was paralyzed, incontinent and unable to speak. I watched the light leave her eyes and her body crumple like a rag doll's, and I knew that one day soon she would say, ""Enough.''   During this period, my mother and I talked and talked and talked about her end-of-life choices, as we had for many years. A decade earlier the conversation had seemed totally academic, even a bit weird. But now we were both grateful that this was familiar territory. At regular family meetings at the nursing home where she lived, the social workers, nurses and doctors joined what had been our private dialog. Our willingness to look my mother's certain death squarely in the eye, they said, was both unusual in families and beneficial to her quality of life.   Despite my mother's helplessness and misery those last months, she wasn't dying of anything. She had a garden-variety set of ailments for an 87-year-old woman: high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, an inner-ear disturbance. A series of imperceptible strokes, known as T.I.A.'s, had left her body useless. But they didn't necessarily portend a deadly event. She'd dodged the bullets of cancer, serious heart or pulmonary disease, and dementia. It is not uncommon, having lived past 85, to keep on living for a very long time -- ""healthy'' in the narrow sense of the word, but increasingly incapacitated. That, alas, was my mother's fate.   She often longed for the oblivion of Alzheimer's disease. But her sharp mind -- she never skipped a beat -- entitled her to organize her own death, within legal limits, which she did by deciding to stop food and hydration. We had discussed and researched this option, and we had read enough to be reasonably confident this manner of dying was not a frightful ordeal but rather a gentle death. We trusted that an enlightened nursing home like the one she was in wouldn't force her to eat and drink. They had readily accepted earlier decisions to forgo diagnostic tests or hospitalizations, and later antibiotics for pneumonia.   Our study of what is known as V.S.E.D., or ""voluntarily stopping eating and drinking,"" was impressive for amateurs, if I do say so myself. My mother had a pretty good death, on her own terms, and we had the nursing home's full support. I'm proud and grateful to have been able to advocate for her and to have been by her side. That said, there were several rough patches. And after recently meeting Judy Schwarz, the patient support coordinator for Compassion & Choices in New York, I now can see we'd have had an easier time of it had she been along for the ride.   What follows are a few of the bumps in the road that I bet would have been smoothed with her expert guidance.   * Medical professionals can only guess how long it takes to die of dehydration. (Merely refusing food is a bad idea, as many people who have gone on long hunger strikes can surely attest.) My mother's nurses and doctors said she'd likely last four, five, six days -- a week at most. With that in mind, I settled into a recliner in her room with books, music, snacks and a few changes of clothes, and I intended to stay by her side, as promised, for the duration.   In fact, she lived for 13 days, alert and communicative for about a week and manifesting none of the signs of impending death until the last 36 to 48 hours. Why the discrepancy? People in my mother's robust condition rarely make this choice. It is typically how people die in the end stages of cancer or Alzheimer's disease, following a progressive loss of interest or ability to eat and drink -- not an abrupt dinner-yesterday-but-no-breakfast-today-thank-you-very-much announcement. I don't know if my mother experienced time as I did, but to me it felt interminable. To my shame, I did a lot of clock-watching. Eventually I went home at night, leaving behind a private-duty aide.   I doubt I'd have twitched with impatience, just wanting for it to be over, had I known that the average dying time is two to three weeks, as the scientific literature says. Judy Schwarz would have told me that. I think the days would have been more peaceful and contemplative had I not been surprised by how long it took.   * Several of my mother's caregivers, both nurses and aides, had moral or religious reservations about her decision. To their credit, they didn't just switch to the other side of the floor. They came to me, in tears, to say this was something their consciences would not permit. They visited her several times a day, but delegated the hands-on responsibilities to others. At the time, I admired their honesty and felt their hurt and love, but I wondered if this behavior was appropriate. Shouldn't they be able to leave their personal convictions at home?   The answer, I now know, is that they followed the canons of their profession perfectly: no health professional is required to participate if that violates a personal belief system. What they are required to do is ensure a smooth hand-off to someone equally qualified.   * During and after my mother's death, I was often stung by the implied or expressed judgments of friends, colleagues and even strangers after I wrote about the experience. ""You let your mother do that?,'' I was frequently asked, with the word ""let'' heavy with opprobrium. My answer, generally, was that it wasn't up to me. She was mentally competent and entitled to do as she pleased. My job as her daughter was to be supportive. Left unsaid, once I'd experienced the first episodes of shock and disapproval, was that I totally agreed with her. Expecting the reaction of others would have helped.   * Once my mother began her fast, the nursing home offered two ways to ensure her comfort. The regular staff could stay in place, keeping her mouth from getting too dry and administering sedatives as needed under the supervision of a palliative care physician. Or a team of hospice professionals, part of what was then a new collaboration with the nursing home, could take their places at the bedside. I opted for the familiar. My mother didn't warm easily to strangers, and I thought she would need the comfort of people she knew well.   A counselor like Ms. Schwarz would have told me that the regulars might ask to be taken off the case, which might have changed my mind. She also would have told me that a hospice team likely would medicate my mother more aggressively, given their training in cutting-edge comfort care. Even if I'd stuck to my plan and later wished I'd chosen hospice, Ms. Schwarz would have suggested a change of course. It never occurred to me that was possible. I was too tired to think straight.  * I have always assumed that what my mother chose to do herself, I could have insisted upon for her, as her health care proxy. In other words, if she were no longer ""decisionally capable,'' though not on the brink of death, I could have told the staff to stop spooning food into her mouth or bringing the straw to her lips, and they would have listened to me as her surrogate. Ms. Schwarz would have told me this isn't so. Other end-of-life experts are less certain but know of no test cases. From that I conclude that V.S.E.D. should be considered a viable option only for cognitively intact men and women. Maybe that's why it's called ""voluntarily stopping eating and drinking.''

197,Alzheimer,2008,The New York Times,Thatcher’s Open Secret,Margaret Thatcher&#39;s Open Secret,"Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has dementia, her daughter says. Is it right to discuss her condition publicly?","A colleague in The Times's London bureau, Sarah Lyall, has just published a book called ""The Anglo Files: A Field Guide to the British,'' a cross-cultural look at what makes the British British, as seen though the eyes of an American expatriate with an English husband whom she describes as ""something out of 'Brideshead Revisited'.'' Given Ms. Lyall's perspective, I asked her thoughts on the recent revelation that former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, like President Ronald Reagan before her, is losing her mind and her memories to a form of dementia. Here are her observations, with a link to the story that is striking a chord on both sides of the Atlantic. -- Jane Gross  (Photo: President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Mrs. Thatcher's daughter recently has been criticized for publicly discussing her mother's dementia. (Associated Press))   In Britain, it has long been an open secret that former prime minister Margaret Thatcher has been sliding into dementia. ""Open"" because old friends and political allies can all see the changes in the proud woman known as the Iron Lady, particularly since she suffered a series of mini-strokes in 2002 and withdrew from public speaking on her doctors' advice. And ""secret"" because no one has spoken publicly about it.   Until now. Last month her daughter, Carol Thatcher, revealed all to a newspaper, The Mail on Sunday. In an excerpt from her forthcoming memoir, ""A Swim-On Part in the Goldfish Bowl,"" Carol Thatcher not only announced that her mother, now 82, is suffering from dementia but offered excruciating evidence.   Sometimes Mrs. Thatcher forgets what she has eaten for breakfast, her daughter wrote. Once she conflated the Falklands War with the Bosnian conflict. Cruelly, she has had to be reminded repeatedly that her beloved husband, Denis, is dead. (He died in 2003.)  Carol Thatcher's heartbreak at seeing her formidable mother reduced to a confused old woman is all too familiar to anyone caring for a friend or relative suffering a similar fate. But Mrs. Thatcher is an iconic and larger-than-life figure -- ""far more than the sum of her parts,"" Vanessa Feltz wrote in the Daily Express -- and Britain is still a country where privacy, particularly in matters of health, is valued. Many people have reacted angrily to Carol Thatcher's disclosures.   In The Daily Telegraph, Andrew Pierce noted that Mrs. Thatcher's friends had purposely kept silent, in order to ""preserve the great lady's dignity and grace in a quiet, discreet way."" In The Daily Express, Anne Widdecombe, a Tory M.P., said, ""The only consolation, perhaps, is that Margaret Thatcher almost certainly does not know what her daughter has done."" And in The Sun, Kelvin MacKenzie raised the issue of who owns the reputation of a public figure like Mrs. Thatcher -- her family or the wider world?   ""My question is: why did Carol think it right to reveal her mother's plight, especially when none of her political friends had ever done so even in their political books?"" he asked. ""I can only conclude it was done for money. I hope she feels proud of herself."" And across the Atlantic, Ronald Reagan Jr. -- whose father publicly announced at age 82 that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease -- called Carol Thatcher's detailed account ""in monumentally bad taste and unnecessary.""   But the debate doesn't end there.   On the one hand, it does seem to violate a proud woman's privacy to describe the sad diminishment of her formidable powers, particularly when she doesn't seem capable -- as President Reagan was -- of making the disclosures herself. On the other hand, it makes her poignantly human. Many of our parents will, in the end, suffer what she is suffering; many of us will, too, when our turn comes.   So why the secrecy and shame? Many people who have written to the British papers and posted on various Web sites have made robust arguments for speaking openly about one of the great taboos of our time. As a friend of mine put it, ""If you refuse to talk about it, you're treating it as something shameful,"" once the common response to cancer.   My friend is acquainted with a 71-year-old woman whose mind is slipping. Her husband knows it; her acquaintances know it; she herself knows it on some level, despite her doctor's euphemistic diagnosis. She anxiously asks whether she is repeating things (she is) and frets that she is forgetting what she used to remember (she is).   But she refuses to confront the obvious, and her friends have all been forced to join this conspiracy of silence. This means there is a lot of speculating and gossiping about her condition. How bad is it? Can we bring it up with her husband? What plans is she making for the future? At the same time, there is no real chance to acknowledge the reality or commiserate with the family's pain. ",[]
271,Alzheimer,2008,The New York Times,When Medicare Falls Short,When Medicare Falls Short,"Unable to accept new Medicare patients, a physician in Chicago resorts to a new kind of geriatric assessment. Is this the future of care for the elderly?","(Photo: Dr. Cheryl Woodson, a geriatrician in Chicago Heights, Ill., attends to patient Adeline Robinson, who is in her 90s. Dr. Woodson says she can no longer afford to accept new patients on Medicare. (Sally Ryan for The New York Times))    For Dr. Cheryl E. Woodson, geriatric medicine is a passion that doesn't pay the bills.   ""I love this. I just love this,'' she said one recent afternoon in her office in Chicago Heights, Ill. Dr. Woodson had just diagnosed early-stage dementia in a 73-year-old patient, recommending a hip replacement while the woman is still cognitively capable of rehabilitation, and then had consoled the woman's weeping daughter.   But Dr. Woodson can no longer afford to run her solo practice as she once did. She has stopped taking new patients over the age of 65, when Medicare kicks in, since reimbursement for their care is now ""40 cents on the dollar,'' she said, not enough to staff her office and pay the rent.   ""If I take new Medicare patients, I can't keep the door open,'' Dr. Woodson said. With Medicare paying less now then it did in 2001, she added, ""you can serve seniors or feed your children."" Not both.  Dr. Woodson's dilemma is shared by many internists and family practitioners, endangered specialists in a health care system that pays for procedures and tests but not for the time-consuming management of chronic conditions. ""We get paid to do things to people, not for people,'' Dr. Woodson is fond of saying.   This is especially true for the elderly, who are generally not good candidates for we-can-fix-it medicine. Instead, as they lose mobility, cognition and thus independence, they require lengthy office visits, close monitoring and supportive services. These days, it is difficult to find a new doctor for anyone over the age of 65, because they are so expensive to treat.   Dr. Woodson's solution to the cash crunch is to keep her existing elderly patients and to turn away new ones. At the same time, however, she has begun providing geriatric consultations, much like a cardiologist or orthopedist might. Each Wednesday afternoon, she does three such consultations, each at least an hour long, which produce what she calls a ""level-of-care prescription'' that the primary-care physician and family can implement on their own.   The goal of the assessment is to determine what's wrong with the elderly patient, whether it can be fixed and how to manage things if it can't be, which is often the case. Each appraisal details the patient's overall health status and involves a review of current medications, level of independence, mobility, behavior and memory.   From that assessment comes a recommendation of what services are needed, who can deliver them and where that is best accomplished: at home, in a retirement facility or in a nursing home. That determination is not based soley on a patient's condition, but also on how much hands-on care family members are willing and able to provide and how much hired help they can afford. Often the evaluation is followed by a family meeting, with Dr. Woodson as referee.   One recent Wednesday, I observed as Dr. Woodson performed two office assessments and convened a family meeting via conference call. It is not as satisfying as an all-geriatric practice, she told me, and some of the consultation patients wish they could stay. But a little geriatrics is better than none at all, and this approach could be the wave of the future.  The first assessment involved a 79-year-old woman with dementia so advanced she was unable to answer the doctor's questions or follow her instructions during a cognitive exam, rearranging the contents of her purse instead of drawing a clock with its hands at 11:10, as Dr. Woodson had gently requested. When asked to spell the word ""world"" both forward and backward, the patient declared, ""I really have to go now.''  The woman, who lives in a facility for those with Alzheimer's disease, was taking a cornucopia of medications likely to exacerbate her confusion and increase the odds of a serious fall. Dr. Woodson later suggested altering the regime. She also advised the woman's stepdaughters against any tests or procedures designed to prolong the patient's life rather than improve its quality. The patient's severe neck pain was likely the result of arthritis, Dr. Woodson said, and nothing could be done for it but pain medication and heat. So why subject her to a M.R.I.?   The second assessment involved a 73-year-old woman with subtle signs of dementia noticeable only to a professional or a close family member. She also was suffering from necrosis of the hip and rated the pain as 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. Dr. Woodson adjusted the length of the woman's cane, confirmed her daughter's fear that some recent erratic behavior was consistent with very early dementia, and urged hip surgery to relieve the pain while the patient could still follow the directions of a physical therapist.   The phone consultation involved an 87-year-old woman at an assisted living facility whose health was in steep decline. Now she needed services not included in her monthly rent: someone to dispense medication four times a day, help her into compression stockings each morning to reduce swelling in her legs, provide three treatments a day with a nebulizer to facilitate her breathing and accompany her to numerous doctors' appointments. At the moment, the woman's daughter, who had a job and family, was doing all of this and more.   One alternative, Dr. Woodson told the woman's son, was to hire private-duty health aides and a geriatric care manager to take some of the burden off his sister. The other was to move his mother to a nursing home, where a 24/7 staff would either do or arrange everything. The son was resistant to the first because of the expense and to the second because he preferred the beautiful setting at the assisted living facility to the hospital-like environment of a nursing home.   The call ended without a resolution. ""I'm not sure he understands there is no level of care between assisted living and a nursing home,'' Dr. Woodson said later. ""As his mother's condition worsens, they are going to need more and more services. One person can't handle this, and I think he's only giving only lip service to the amount of work his sister is doing.''  How I would have loved hearing this kind of medical advice when my mother's needs exceeded what an assisted living facility could deliver or when there was conflict between me and my brother. I was too ignorant to look for a geriatrician and in any event probably wouldn't have been able to find one, given the crisis of supply and demand. But even locating a plain-vanilla internist willing to take a new Medicare patient was an ordeal. Everyone we called said his practice was full. Finally, my brother's physician persuaded his sister, also a doctor, to see my mother. I don't know what we would have done otherwise.  Have any of you or your loved ones been turned away by physicians unwilling to take on new Medicare patients? Please share your stories -- and if you have any, solutions. The problem will only grow as those of us in our 60s outlive our current doctors or relocate and need to find new ones. ",[]

28,Alzheimer,2009,The New York Times,Testing for Alzheimer’s Risk,Knowing About Forgetting,"With a family history of Alzheimer's disease, even minor memory lapses can be terrifying.","(Photo: Carmel Zucker for The New York TimesThe author at work in her home office in 2007. With a family history of Alzheimer's disease, even occasional lapses in memory cause her to worry.)   This morning I couldn't remember the street number of my house. My own house! Don't panic, I thought, don't struggle to remember it. Just go on with other things, and it'll float to the surface. But it didn't, so I opened the front door and read the street numbers aloud, trying to fix them in my brain.  Lots of people have these lapses, I know. But one week ago, I was sitting with my mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, in a memory care center in Honolulu. We were in the ""living room"" filled with 20 Benjamin Buttons, 20 people aging backward, regressing to infancy. Not in body, as in the movie, but in mind.   One woman who'd been a political journalist sat hugging a teddy bear. ""What is your full name?"" a nurses' assistant asked the group. Half of them shook their heads, baffled. My mother remembers her name but sometimes thinks I'm her older sister. She seems happy, though, as she eats dinner with the group in silence before they're herded to the parlor to watch a DVD of ""The Parent Trap."" She's not suffering, but I am, feeling heartsick every time I drive away.   Not only my mother but both her parents had dementia and were institutionalized. So when I have a lapse like today's, I ask myself, ""Is it starting?""   There's a blood test one can take that shows if you carry a gene that's a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Should I take it? My gut reaction is no, since there's no cure or way to prevent the disease.  Nonetheless, I do research on the genetics of Alzheimer's. According to a report by the Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center, no gene has been identified as the cause of late-onset Alzheimer's, which occurs after 60. (That's not late for this reporter; it's now!) But one genetic risk factor has been confirmed by many studies to increase the likelihood of developing the disease. That risk factor is the gene variant APOE4, found on chromosome 19. If you carry this variant, you're more prone to develop Alzheimer's disease -- 40 percent of people with the disease have APOE4, according to the report.  On the other hand, you may not develop Alzheimer's even if you test positive for APOE4, and if you don't carry the gene, you still may contract the disease.  I make a list of the pro's and con's of testing for APOE4.  PRO:  1. Information is power. Dr. Lenny Guarente, a biology professor at M.I.T. who studies genes that may determine how long we live, says people who test positive for APOE4 often ""handle the information well."" Many prefer to know and adjust to the fact than live with doubts.  2. You can make plans. During my yearly physical, I told my doctor I'm worried about memory loss because dementia runs in my family. He suggested I tell my children how I'd want to be cared for if the need should arise. Ideally, I'd like to be cared for in my home or in a place with some of my friends, where there are animals and gardens, good books read aloud, spiritual talks, music and films better than ""The Parent Trap."" But I don't know of such a place. If I learned that I carry the risk factor for Alzheimer's, I might be propelled to find or create such a situation while I'm still able.  CON:  1. The body is mysterious. Spontaneous healing can occur, and disease can strike people in peak health. In Alzheimer's disease, it's believed that several genes combine with environmental factors to bring on the disease, so why focus on one gene that may or may not be the trigger?   2. We're dealing not with the present but the future. Who knows what medical advances will occur in the next 20 years? Who knows if there'll even be life on the planet?  I could go back and forth, but the salient question is, would I conduct my life differently if I knew I was at risk? Probably not. Still, it would be a terrific comfort to find out I do not have the gene. But is that comfort worth gambling on the far more likely result — learning that I do carry it?  I had an uncle, Art, who in his 80s used to write his address on the back of his hand, explaining with a laugh that if he forgot his address, he'd be able to get home. At the time I thought he was joking, but now I know he was not.   And he never developed Alzheimer's.   Sara Davidson is the author of ""Leap: What Will We Do With the Rest of Our Lives?""      ",[]

63,Alzheimer,2009,The New York Times,Is a Mediterranean Diet Good for the Brain?,Mediterranean Diet May Prevent Mental Decline,A Mediterranean-style diet appears to be good for the brain as well as the heart.,"Eating a Mediterranean diet appears to lower risk for mental decline, and may help prevent Alzheimer's in people with existing memory problems, new research suggests.  The finding, published today in The Archives of Neurology, tracked the eating habits of 1,393 people with no cognitive problems and 482 patients with mild cognitive impairment, a preliminary state of mental decline that can sometimes signal the onset of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. The patients were then grouped based on whether they were low, moderate or consistent followers of a Mediterranean diet. People were considered to be strong adherents to a Mediterranean-style diet if they regularly ate large amounts of fish, fruits, vegetables, legumes and monounsaturated fats like olive oil, while at the same time consuming moderate amounts of alcohol and only small quantities of meat and dairy products.  After nearly five years of follow up, about 275 people in the healthy group developed mild cognitive impairment. People who closely adhered to a Mediterranean diet had a 28 percent lower risk of developing mild cognitive impairment, compared to those whose eating habits were the least like a Mediterranean diet. Moderate followers of a Mediterranean diet showed a trend toward a 17 percent lower risk than the lowest-scoring group, although that finding wasn't statistically significant.  A Mediterranean diet also appeared to slow decline in those already diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. Among the 482 men and women with mild cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study, 106 developed Alzheimer's disease about four years later. But among those who strictly adhered to the Mediterranean diet, risk of Alzheimer's was 48 percent lower, while risk was 45 percent lower among those who ate a moderate version of the diet.  It's not clear from the study how long the participants had been following a Mediterranean eating plan. However, the researchers said that older people tend to be fairly set in their ways and stick to eating patterns that have been established years earlier, so it's likely the habits were established at least in middle age. The average age of study participants was 77.  Because the study was observational and not a controlled clinical trial, the association of better brain aging with the consumption of a Mediterranean diet isn't definitive and could be explained by other factors. However, researchers note that a Mediterranean diet has already been shown to be good for the heart, and there is no risk in improving eating habits in the hope of improving brain health as well.  ""We know it's a healthy diet for other reasons,'' said lead author Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, assistant professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Center. ""It makes sense for people to eat in a healthy way as soon as they can and for the longest they possibly can.'' ",[]
194,Alzheimer,2009,The New York Times,Erasing Your Memories,Erasing Your Memories,Dr. Todd C. Sacktor answers readers' questions about research into the selective erasure of memory.,"What would your life be like if you could erase certain memories? Maybe you could ""forget"" about some traumatic event, a deep-seated fear or a relationship gone wrong.   It seems like science fiction, but researchers may be on the verge of making memory erasure a reality.  (Photo: Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times Dr. Todd C. Sacktor)   Dr. Todd C. Sacktor and his team of scientists from SUNY Downstate Medical Center have been able to show how a single dose of an experimental drug can block the ability of an animal's brain to hold onto specific types of memories.   To read more about Dr. Sacktor's work, read Benedict Carey's article, ""Brain Researchers Open Door to Editing Memory.""   Dr. Sacktor's research raises some interesting questions. How will erasing specific memories affect humans? Will this work lead to a treatment to allow us to retain memory longer?   This week, Dr. Sacktor will answer your questions about memory erasure. Please post your questions and comments below, and check back daily for his responses.    In Response to the Ethical Questions  This strikes me as one of those things that could be extremely dangerous if used improperly. Even ignoring the potential illegal uses, allowing people to erase negative memories is a bad idea.   I'm in general disinclined to promote any kind of ignorance - even if that ignorance would make a person happier. We learn from the past, right? Well, we're supposed to. And sometimes it is learning from painful memories that we become better people.  The only time I can imagine this being okay is in cases of serious, horrendous trauma - rape victims who now cannot live normal lives, child abuse victims, etc. Only in situations where a person has been completely destroyed from an experience, where there is nothing positive to learn. But even then, we are denying reality, denying life. And for better or worse, our memories define who we are.  - James W., Washington D.C.    Dr. Sacktor: The purpose of our experiment with ZIP was to try to understand the molecular basis of memory storage, which previously was a complete scientific mystery. The experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that memories are stored by the action of a specific molecule- PKMzeta. You should know that the notion that a specific molecule stores memory goes completely against the grain of how most neuroscientists have thought about long-term memory for decades. Most neuroscientists thought that memories were stored by anatomical changes in the brain, such as new synapses, not by specific molecules. That is why our results showing a very rapid disruption of long-term memories, first published in Science in 2006, were so striking. The results have been confirmed in many labs around the world, with different drugs that inhibit PKMzeta, and for many different forms of long-term memory. Interestingly, ZIP does not affect short-term memory, or once the drug is gone, the formation of new long-term memories in the same brain region.  Elucidating the molecular mechanism of long-term memory may one day be key, I hope, to developing treatments of memory disorders. But don't forget how long this development from basic science discovery to clinical usefulness takes- decades for even the most important findings, such as germ theory and the structure of DNA.  One important recent publication by my colleagues at SUNY Downstate, Drs. Sue Mirra, John Crary, and Charles Shao, is that PKMzeta is bound up in the neurofibrillary tangles that are found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's Disease. This is likely to alter the function of PKMzeta and may contribute to the memory loss characteristic of that disorder.  But I think that the concerns, even the deep unease, that many of the questions voice reflect two striking features of the experiments with ZIP that go to the essence of PKMzeta's role in memory- features that are also rather surprising to most neuroscientists. These are, first, the rapidity with which long-term memories, three month-old in the rats and presumably decades-old in humans, might be erased. This happens almost immediately with the injection of the drug. Second, is the specificity. As I mentioned, short-term memory, the underlying structure of the brain, and the capacity to form new long-term memories are unaffected.  These two surprising features are because PKMzeta is an enzyme. If you recall from high-school biology, there are two general forms of proteins, structural and enzymatic. Most neuroscientists had assumed that hundreds of structural proteins would be involved in the new synapses thought to store long-term memory. And there would be nothing unique to the structural proteins in the memory-storing synapses, as opposed to those synapses formed in development prior to experience.  But enzymes catalyze very specific chemical reactions and can be rapidly inhibited. That long-term memories are maintained by the constant action of one such enzyme, and thus that memories can be specifically and rapidly erased, was quite a shock.   The Drug's Uses  What are the primary uses you envision for this drug?  - Rebecka L., New Jersey   Dr. Sacktor: There are a few rare or severe cases of psychiatric or neurological disease in which ZIP might be helpful. I am a neurologist, not a psychiatrist, but I understand that there are clinical situations in which, as a last resort, a procedure known as bilateral cingulotomy can be performed. In this procedure, a small region of the brain is destroyed. I could see that, prior to the destruction of the neural tissue, ZIP might be injected to try to ""reset"" the synapses in that region. The drug diffuses around 1-2 mm from an injection site in the brain, so the region affected would be restricted.  For more general application, we have to develop an activity-dependent form of ZIP, i.e., a drug that becomes active only when the neurons are firing intensely, as when a memory is recalled. This might allow a specific, recalled long-term memory to be erased, rather than all long-term memories. I should add that there is a entire subfield of memory research studying the role of what is called ""reconsolidation blockade"" that aims at essentially the same thing. This work is very exciting and has been lead by my colleagues Karim Nader, Joseph LeDoux, Susan Sara, Cristina Alberini, Yadin Dudai, and others. You may have heard about the studies with propranolol on trying to reduce the emotional component of post-traumatic stress memories. How this reconsolidation work fits in with PKMzeta is actively being explored.  Developing memory enhancers that convert short- into long-term memories by increasing PKMzeta in the brain is also a possibility. This has even been done experimentally in the fruit fly by my colleagues, Jerry Yin and Eric Drier, when at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, and now at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.   Is Memory Loss Permanent?  Has the research been ongoing long enough to answer the question of permanency? Is the memory erased forever? And, further, how does the nature of the drug and its effect (physically and chemically) on the brain lead to greater understanding of how memory works. Will dementia figure in the coming research? - William H. Porter   Dr. Sacktor: Three month-old memories in the rat have been erased. Although I don't really buy the analogy, this is equivalent to a 10 year-old memory for a human (rats live around 2 years). I do not see any compelling reason why a three month-old memory would have a biologically different basis than a decades-old memory, but you never know.  We, as well as other researchers, have done extensive experiments to try to see if, once disrupted by ZIP, a memory ever comes back. We waited weeks, we gave reminders, but the memory never seemed to return. Remarkably, giving the drug right before or even during the training had no effect on long-term memory formation tested a few days later. The drug has a pure ""retrograde"" effect. That's why it's so different from clinical cases of amnesia due to brain injuries or dementias like Alzheimer's, which affect both formation of new memories and recall of old. Our experimental result also suggests that the PKMzeta is not made immediately during learning, but after a few hours, and that the drug itself only lasts a few hours.  Please check my other responses for answers to your other questions. Thanks. ",[]
216,Alzheimer,2009,The New York Times,When It Isn’t Really Senility,When It Isn&#39;t Really Senility,"Many cases of so-called dementia are reversible, experts say.","When Jane Simpson's mother, then 91, started showing signs of memory loss in December 2007, Ms. Simpson thought age had finally caught up with her. ""As this had been a gradual process, and considering her age, we were not unduly alarmed — just saddened that it seemed we were losing my mother mentally,"" she wrote in an e-mail to this blog.  But on a visit six months later, Ms. Simpson, a 61-year-old advertising copywriter in North Carolina, was struck by how much worse her mother's memory loss had become and by her confusion about everything happening around her.  Just typical 91-year-old behavior? Just the first signs of the inevitable slide toward dementia we all may face if we live long enough? Not at all.  Since the '70s, geriatric specialists have been aware of many unusual causes of memory loss, confusion and disorientation in older people. These include not just medical conditions ranging from urinary tract infection to hydrocephalus to the flu, but also side effects from many commonly used medications.   Often, doctors and family members disregard these symptoms, thinking that they are just signs of an inevitable age-related decline. But many cases of pseudo-senility, as it's called, are reversible — if they are caught early enough.   By coincidence, Ms. Simpson had recently read a short article in her local newspaper about the side effects in the elderly of a bladder control drug called Ditropan, which include severe memory loss. Her mother was taking Ditropan.  Ms. Simpson and her sister got their mother switched to an alternative bladder control drug, Enablex. Sure enough, her mental symptoms eased. ""Within three months,"" Ms. Simpson recalled in her e-mail, ""we felt that we had our mother back.""   You'd think that with the constant attention being paid to Alzheimer's disease and other causes of memory loss in aging, doctors would have learned by now that severe memory loss in healthy aging is a problem to be diagnosed, not an inevitability to be lived with and accepted.   But according to the National Institute on Aging, missed diagnoses of reversible dementia still occur too often. ""Some physical and mental changes occur with age in healthy people,"" the agency writes in a publication called ""Forgetfulness."" ""However, much pain and suffering can be avoided if older people, their families, and their doctors recognize dementia as a disease, not part of normal aging.""  Reversible causes of dementia include the side effects of many medications. Ditropan is only the most recent addition to the list, occasioned in part by a study by U.S. Navy neurologist Dr. Jack Tsao involving 870 men and women with an average age of 75. The subjects, who were all Catholic priests, nuns and brothers, were followed for almost eight years. At a 2008 meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, Dr. Tsao reported that those who were taking anticholinergic drugs — a class that includes not only Detrol but also drugs to treat hypertension, asthma and Parkinson's disease — had a 50 percent higher rate of cognitive decline than those who were not.  According to Dr. Samuel Gandy, a neurologist at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan, drugs with antihistamines often cause mental confusion and sedation in the elderly — especially those containing the antihistamine doxylamine, such as the sleep aid Unisom. In addition, confusion and forgetfulness in the elderly can be caused by malnutrition, chronic alcoholism and metabolic disturbances such as thyroid, kidney or liver disorders — and even on occasion by something as common as dehydration or a high fever.  Doctors are better than they used to be at diagnosing pseudosenility, according to Dr. Gandy. ""Most physicians are taught in medical schools to evaluate a patient for dementia by first excluding the reversible causes,"" he said.   But one kind remains a particular problem, he added: depression masquerading as dementia. Doctors can't simply order a test to rule it out; the best they can do is recommend a trial run of antidepressant therapy, he said, ""to see if the person will perk up and come back.""   First, though, the physician must think of something other than aging as a possible cause of the symptoms.  ",[]
