Born in Hammond, Indiana on December 2, 1915, to Samuel & Jennie Kleinberg Levin, Sylvia was an alumni of Indiana University where she met her husband and fellow alumni William Silberstein. They subsequently married in 1937, and lived in Hammond until 1950. She and her family moved to Scarsdale in 1950 and to Rye, New York in 1968. Sylvia will be most remembered for her great sense of humor, buoyant spirit and constant smile. Her charm was contagious and she was adored by her many friends. Sylvia was noted for her culinary expertise, her love of classical music, the theater, tennis & was often consulted for her vast knowledge of travel due to her extensive world travel. Sylvia was a longstanding member of the Quaker Ridge Golf Club since 1955. She possessed sound business acumen and helped her husband found Sealectro Corporation in Mamaroneck, New York. She was also very active in the creation of various philanthropic programs. In 1984, Sylvia and her husband established the first fully endowed athletic scholarship at Indiana University and thereafter two additonal endowed athletic scholarships. Their other philanthropic endeavors include the William & Sylvia Silberstein Aging and Dementia Research Center at New York University Medical Center, the William & Sylvia Silberstein Cardiac Center at White Plains Hospital Center, and most recently, the William and Sylvia Silberstein Pavilion at White Plains Hospital Center. Sylvia supported many other charities including Cystic Fibrosis and U.J.A. amongst others. Her generous philosophy was apparent during World War II when she was President of Hammond, Indiana chapter of B'nai B'rith and she established a welcoming committee for all servicemen's trains providing food and other nourishment to them. Sylvia is survived by her husand, William of Rye, New York, her daughter Betsy Levinson of Stamford, Connecticut; her son Bruce and his wife, Carolyn, of New York City; her son, Sigmund of Boca Raton, Florida, and six loving grandchildren, Beth, Lori and Debra, Jill, Michael and Matthew; and a sister, Arlene Pascal of Highland Park, Illinois.

But over the course of their treatment, the cure was frequently more painful than the affliction, never more so than when patients first became aware of their past behavior, their dementia-fueled outbursts against loved ones, staff and themselves. They now found themselves stranded in a no-man's land between delusion and clarity -- often sad, occasionally humorous. One psychiatrist picked up the phone one day to a panicked, unidentified voice warning of an impending attack at a certain foreign embassy.","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Mental Health and Disorders', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Tests and Testing', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]"

Dr. Berg did his residency in psychiatry at Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital, and remained on staff there for over 30 years, ultimately serving as Psychiatric Unit Chief of Ward No. 6 for many years. During that time, he also taught at the N.Y.U. School of Medicine and Hunter College-Bellevue School of Nursing, and maintained a part-time private practice.

The records say that Ms. Parks, who will turn 92 next month, was suffering from progressive dementia in October 2002. On Wednesday, in response to a request by The Detroit Free Press, a federal judge in Detroit released the six pages of medical information. Gregory Reed, the lawyer who filed two lawsuits on Ms. Parks's behalf contending that members of the music industry had used her name in a song without permission, said her medical records should not affect the two related lawsuits, filed in 1999 and 2004. The suits, which named Ms. Parks as the plaintiff, accused the rap group OutKast, BMG and several record companies and music distributors of defamation. But some relatives of Ms. Parks have since expressed doubt that she understood the lawsuits and have said they think she was exploited.

Father of NBA legend and Hall of Famer Kareem Abdul Jabbar, died on December 9 at 3:00 P.M. EST at Coney Island Hospital in Coney Island, NY, from organ failure after a long bout with senile dementia. He was 86. A decorated member of the NYPD and veteran of the United States Armed Forces from 1941-1945, Mr. Alcindor received three commendations for outstanding police work as a patrolman in 1961 and then as a lieutenant in 1966 and 1978. In addition, he was awarded a medal at City Hall by New York City Mayor Abraham D. Beame. An avid musician, Mr. Alcindor brought his talents on the trombone to the New York Transit Authority Police Band, even playing at the 1962 Democratic National Convention. His musical talents also led to his involvement in one of the most famous events in U.S. history, as Mr. Alcindor was in attendance as a band member when Marilyn Monroe serenaded President John F. Kennedy with ""Happy Birthday"" at Madison Square Garden on May 19, 1962, an event, according to his son, he never forgot. Born in Brooklyn, NY, Mr. Alcindor attended Franklin K. Lane High School where he teamed with legendary Knicks coach Red Holzman on the school's handball team that captured the city championship. He followed that up by attending the Juilliard School to pursue his career ambitions of becoming a musician. Hopeful of one day playing with the Count Basie Band, Mr. Alcindor enjoyed working with some of the musical giants of his time, including Dizzy Gillespie, Art Blakey, Kenny Durham, Al Gray and Tito Puente. He also had a stint playing with the Benny Carter Band in the late 70's and early 80's. Married for 53 years, Mr. Alcindor's wife, Cora, passed away eight years ago. He is survived by his son, Kareem; and five grandchildren.","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'ALCINDOR, FERDINAND L.', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]"

By Rodney Rothman. (Simon & Schuster, $23.) Here's hoping that Rothman has overcome his nasty fabrication habit, because if the stories and people in his new book, ""Early Bird,"" are real, he has produced a warm, wry bit of reportage. Rothman earned some ignominy in 2000 when an article he wrote for The New Yorker turned out to have fictions mixed in with its facts, causing the magazine to run an apology. That article involved his posing as an employee at a dot-com company, and in ""Early Bird"" Rodman poses again, in a way: he retires to Florida, in his late 20's, moving into a Century Village senior citizens' complex. Rothman manages to be both an observer of these strange beings about three times his age and a sad-sack newcomer trying to blend in with them. He is working a bit of a stereotype, but his descriptions of the loneliness, the cliquishness, the slow-motion desperation of the place ring true and bittersweet. Most surprising is that his tales contain not an ounce of mean-spiritedness -- this from someone who once wrote for David Letterman. ""Young people often think old people all look the same,"" he writes in a passage typical of his tone, ""but that misconception works both ways. To elderly people, young people merge into one tender pink blob. Elderly people always seem to think I am 18 or 19, which is flattering until I remember that their eyesight is failing and that a certain percentage of them suffer from dementia.""

Common difficulties include: • Word- or name-finding problems noticeable to family or close associates • Decreased ability to remember names when introduced to new people • Performance issues in social or work settings noticeable to family, friends or co-workers • Reading a passage and retaining little material • Losing or misplacing a valuable object • Decline in ability to plan or organize Stage 4: Moderate cognitive decline At this stage, a careful medical interview detects clear-cut deficiencies in the following areas: • Decreased knowledge of recent occasions or current events • Impaired ability to perform challenging mental arithmetic-for example, to count backward from 100 by 7s • Decreased capacity to perform complex tasks, such as marketing, planning dinner for guests or paying bills and managing finances • Reduced memory of personal history • The affected individual may seem subdued and withdrawn, especially in socially or mentally challenging situations Stage 5: Moderately severe cognitive decline Major gaps in memory and deficits in cognitive function emerge. Some assistance with day-to-day activities becomes essential. At this stage, individuals may: • Be unable during a medical interview to recall such important details as their current address, their telephone number or the name of the college or high school from which they graduated • Become confused about where they are or about the date, day of the week, or season • Have trouble with less challenging mental arithmetic; for example, counting backward from 40 by 4s or from 20 by 2s • Need help choosing proper clothing for the season or the occasion • Usually retain substantial knowledge about themselves and know their own name and the names of their spouse or children • Usually require no assistance with eating or using the toilet Stage 6: Severe cognitive decline Memory difficulties continue to worsen, significant personality changes may emerge and affected individuals need extensive help with customary daily activities. At this stage, individuals may: • Lose most awareness of recent experiences and events as well as of their surroundings • Recollect their personal history imperfectly, although they generally recall their own name • Occasionally forget the name of their spouse or primary caregiver but generally can distinguish familiar from unfamiliar faces • Need help getting dressed properly; without supervision, may make such errors as putting pajamas over daytime clothes or shoes on wrong feet • Experience disruption of their normal sleep/waking cycle • Need help with handling details of toileting (flushing toilet, wiping and disposing of tissue properly) • Have increasing episodes of urinary or fecal incontinence • Experience significant personality changes and behavioral symptoms, including suspiciousness and delusions (for example, believing that their caregiver is an impostor); hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not really there); or compulsive, repetitive behaviors such as hand-wringing or tissue shredding • Tend to wander and become lost Stage 7: Very severe cognitive decline This is the final stage of the disease when individuals lose the ability to respond to their environment, the ability to speak and, ultimately, the ability to control movement. • Frequently individuals lose their capacity for recognizable speech, although words or phrases may occasionally be uttered • Individuals need help with eating and toileting and there is general incontinence of urine • Individuals lose the ability to walk without assistance, then the ability to sit without support, the ability to smile, and the ability to hold their head up. Reflexes become abnormal and muscles grow rigid. Swallowing is impaired. ","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': ""Alzheimer's Disease"", 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]"

It's long been known that social relationships can decrease the risk of developing dementia. In June, Harvard researchers reported how active socializing in old age could delay memory problems.   But most research on social relationships and dementia measures the social life of the very old. The newest study, presented at the 2008 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease in Chicago, focused on the effect relationships in midlife may have on long-term risk. It tracked 2,000 men and women in Finland beginning at the age of 50 and followed up with them 21 years later.   They found that people who were living with a spouse or a partner in midlife ran a 50 percent lower risk of developing dementia during their older years than people living alone. How long a person had been single and the reason they were single also affected risk. Living alone for your entire adult life doubled risk, but those who had been married and then divorced and remained single in midlife showed three times the risk.  Those at greatest risk of developing dementia were people who had lost their partner before middle age and then continued to live as a widow or widower. The study showed that these individuals had a six times greater chance of developing Alzheimer's than those who were married.  ""This suggests two influencing factors -- social and intellectual stimulation and trauma,"" said lead author Krister Håkansson, a psychology researcher at Växjö University and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. ""In practice, it shows how important it is to put resources into helping people who have undergone a crisis.""  Dr. Håkansson said future research will focus on whether risk is influenced by the quality of the relationship or whether someone always intended to live a single life or not. ",[]

Here are her observations, with a link to the story that is striking a chord on both sides of the Atlantic. -- Jane Gross  (Photo: President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Mrs. Thatcher's daughter recently has been criticized for publicly discussing her mother's dementia. (Associated Press))   In Britain, it has long been an open secret that former prime minister Margaret Thatcher has been sliding into dementia. ""Open"" because old friends and political allies can all see the changes in the proud woman known as the Iron Lady, particularly since she suffered a series of mini-strokes in 2002 and withdrew from public speaking on her doctors' advice. And ""secret"" because no one has spoken publicly about it.   Until now. Last month her daughter, Carol Thatcher, revealed all to a newspaper, The Mail on Sunday. In an excerpt from her forthcoming memoir, ""A Swim-On Part in the Goldfish Bowl,"" Carol Thatcher not only announced that her mother, now 82, is suffering from dementia but offered excruciating evidence.   Sometimes Mrs. Thatcher forgets what she has eaten for breakfast, her daughter wrote. Once she conflated the Falklands War with the Bosnian conflict. Cruelly, she has had to be reminded repeatedly that her beloved husband, Denis, is dead. (He died in 2003.)  Carol Thatcher's heartbreak at seeing her formidable mother reduced to a confused old woman is all too familiar to anyone caring for a friend or relative suffering a similar fate. But Mrs. Thatcher is an iconic and larger-than-life figure -- ""far more than the sum of her parts,"" Vanessa Feltz wrote in the Daily Express -- and Britain is still a country where privacy, particularly in matters of health, is valued. Many people have reacted angrily to Carol Thatcher's disclosures.   In The Daily Telegraph, Andrew Pierce noted that Mrs. Thatcher's friends had purposely kept silent, in order to ""preserve the great lady's dignity and grace in a quiet, discreet way."" In The Daily Express, Anne Widdecombe, a Tory M.P., said, ""The only consolation, perhaps, is that Margaret Thatcher almost certainly does not know what her daughter has done."" And in The Sun, Kelvin MacKenzie raised the issue of who owns the reputation of a public figure like Mrs. Thatcher -- her family or the wider world?   ""My question is: why did Carol think it right to reveal her mother's plight, especially when none of her political friends had ever done so even in their political books?"" he asked. ""I can only conclude it was done for money. I hope she feels proud of herself."" And across the Atlantic, Ronald Reagan Jr. -- whose father publicly announced at age 82 that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease -- called Carol Thatcher's detailed account ""in monumentally bad taste and unnecessary.""   But the debate doesn't end there.   On the one hand, it does seem to violate a proud woman's privacy to describe the sad diminishment of her formidable powers, particularly when she doesn't seem capable -- as President Reagan was -- of making the disclosures herself. On the other hand, it makes her poignantly human. Many of our parents will, in the end, suffer what she is suffering; many of us will, too, when our turn comes.   So why the secrecy and shame? Many people who have written to the British papers and posted on various Web sites have made robust arguments for speaking openly about one of the great taboos of our time. As a friend of mine put it, ""If you refuse to talk about it, you're treating it as something shameful,"" once the common response to cancer.   My friend is acquainted with a 71-year-old woman whose mind is slipping. Her husband knows it; her acquaintances know it; she herself knows it on some level, despite her doctor's euphemistic diagnosis. She anxiously asks whether she is repeating things (she is) and frets that she is forgetting what she used to remember (she is).   But she refuses to confront the obvious, and her friends have all been forced to join this conspiracy of silence. This means there is a lot of speculating and gossiping about her condition. How bad is it? Can we bring it up with her husband? What plans is she making for the future? At the same time, there is no real chance to acknowledge the reality or commiserate with the family's pain. ",[]

52,dementia,2008,The New York Times,When Medicare Falls Short,When Medicare Falls Short,"Unable to accept new Medicare patients, a physician in Chicago resorts to a new kind of geriatric assessment. Is this the future of care for the elderly?","(Photo: Dr. Cheryl Woodson, a geriatrician in Chicago Heights, Ill., attends to patient Adeline Robinson, who is in her 90s. Dr. Woodson says she can no longer afford to accept new patients on Medicare. (Sally Ryan for The New York Times))    For Dr. Cheryl E. Woodson, geriatric medicine is a passion that doesn't pay the bills.   ""I love this. I just love this,'' she said one recent afternoon in her office in Chicago Heights, Ill. Dr. Woodson had just diagnosed early-stage dementia in a 73-year-old patient, recommending a hip replacement while the woman is still cognitively capable of rehabilitation, and then had consoled the woman's weeping daughter.   But Dr. Woodson can no longer afford to run her solo practice as she once did. She has stopped taking new patients over the age of 65, when Medicare kicks in, since reimbursement for their care is now ""40 cents on the dollar,'' she said, not enough to staff her office and pay the rent.   ""If I take new Medicare patients, I can't keep the door open,'' Dr. Woodson said. With Medicare paying less now then it did in 2001, she added, ""you can serve seniors or feed your children."" Not both.  Dr. Woodson's dilemma is shared by many internists and family practitioners, endangered specialists in a health care system that pays for procedures and tests but not for the time-consuming management of chronic conditions. ""We get paid to do things to people, not for people,'' Dr. Woodson is fond of saying.   This is especially true for the elderly, who are generally not good candidates for we-can-fix-it medicine. Instead, as they lose mobility, cognition and thus independence, they require lengthy office visits, close monitoring and supportive services. These days, it is difficult to find a new doctor for anyone over the age of 65, because they are so expensive to treat.   Dr. Woodson's solution to the cash crunch is to keep her existing elderly patients and to turn away new ones. At the same time, however, she has begun providing geriatric consultations, much like a cardiologist or orthopedist might. Each Wednesday afternoon, she does three such consultations, each at least an hour long, which produce what she calls a ""level-of-care prescription'' that the primary-care physician and family can implement on their own.   The goal of the assessment is to determine what's wrong with the elderly patient, whether it can be fixed and how to manage things if it can't be, which is often the case. Each appraisal details the patient's overall health status and involves a review of current medications, level of independence, mobility, behavior and memory.   From that assessment comes a recommendation of what services are needed, who can deliver them and where that is best accomplished: at home, in a retirement facility or in a nursing home. That determination is not based soley on a patient's condition, but also on how much hands-on care family members are willing and able to provide and how much hired help they can afford. Often the evaluation is followed by a family meeting, with Dr. Woodson as referee.   One recent Wednesday, I observed as Dr. Woodson performed two office assessments and convened a family meeting via conference call. It is not as satisfying as an all-geriatric practice, she told me, and some of the consultation patients wish they could stay. But a little geriatrics is better than none at all, and this approach could be the wave of the future.  The first assessment involved a 79-year-old woman with dementia so advanced she was unable to answer the doctor's questions or follow her instructions during a cognitive exam, rearranging the contents of her purse instead of drawing a clock with its hands at 11:10, as Dr. Woodson had gently requested. When asked to spell the word ""world"" both forward and backward, the patient declared, ""I really have to go now.''  The woman, who lives in a facility for those with Alzheimer's disease, was taking a cornucopia of medications likely to exacerbate her confusion and increase the odds of a serious fall. Dr. Woodson later suggested altering the regime. She also advised the woman's stepdaughters against any tests or procedures designed to prolong the patient's life rather than improve its quality. The patient's severe neck pain was likely the result of arthritis, Dr. Woodson said, and nothing could be done for it but pain medication and heat. So why subject her to a M.R.I.?   The second assessment involved a 73-year-old woman with subtle signs of dementia noticeable only to a professional or a close family member. She also was suffering from necrosis of the hip and rated the pain as 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. Dr. Woodson adjusted the length of the woman's cane, confirmed her daughter's fear that some recent erratic behavior was consistent with very early dementia, and urged hip surgery to relieve the pain while the patient could still follow the directions of a physical therapist.   The phone consultation involved an 87-year-old woman at an assisted living facility whose health was in steep decline. Now she needed services not included in her monthly rent: someone to dispense medication four times a day, help her into compression stockings each morning to reduce swelling in her legs, provide three treatments a day with a nebulizer to facilitate her breathing and accompany her to numerous doctors' appointments. At the moment, the woman's daughter, who had a job and family, was doing all of this and more.   One alternative, Dr. Woodson told the woman's son, was to hire private-duty health aides and a geriatric care manager to take some of the burden off his sister. The other was to move his mother to a nursing home, where a 24/7 staff would either do or arrange everything. The son was resistant to the first because of the expense and to the second because he preferred the beautiful setting at the assisted living facility to the hospital-like environment of a nursing home.   The call ended without a resolution. ""I'm not sure he understands there is no level of care between assisted living and a nursing home,'' Dr. Woodson said later. ""As his mother's condition worsens, they are going to need more and more services. One person can't handle this, and I think he's only giving only lip service to the amount of work his sister is doing.''  How I would have loved hearing this kind of medical advice when my mother's needs exceeded what an assisted living facility could deliver or when there was conflict between me and my brother. I was too ignorant to look for a geriatrician and in any event probably wouldn't have been able to find one, given the crisis of supply and demand. But even locating a plain-vanilla internist willing to take a new Medicare patient was an ordeal. Everyone we called said his practice was full. Finally, my brother's physician persuaded his sister, also a doctor, to see my mother. I don't know what we would have done otherwise.  Have any of you or your loved ones been turned away by physicians unwilling to take on new Medicare patients? Please share your stories -- and if you have any, solutions. The problem will only grow as those of us in our 60s outlive our current doctors or relocate and need to find new ones. ",[]

Maybe so. But that's because people are not allowed to die of old age -- at least, old age cannot be listed as the cause of death on the official documents, according to both the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization, repositories of the world's mortality statistics.   Neither should ""infirmity'' or ""senescence'' appear as a cause of death, according to the C.D.C. handbook on how properly to fill out a death certificate. Why? These words ""have little value for public health or medical research,"" the agency says. Plus, ""Age is recorded elsewhere on the [death] certificate.''   (Photo: A sample death certificate and instructional text from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ""Physicians' Handbook on Medical Certification of Death."" (Jonathan Corum/The New York Times))   Instead, every death must be attributed to a single disease, which is the immediate cause of death. A second disease may be cited as the intermediate cause, and a third as the underlying condition. Even in situations ""when a number of conditions or multiple organ/system failure resulted in death,'' the C.D.C. instructs that ""the physician, medical examiner or coroner should choose...a clear and distinct etiological sequence,'' a ""chain of morbid events.''  It sounds orderly, doesn't it? But 80- and 90-year-olds don't usually die of one thing. Little by little, the wheels fall off the bicycle. The first few times, you patch everything up. But it's never quite the same. Each setback is a little worse than the last. Bad stuff happens more often. Eventually, as with all machines, the human body simply wears out.   In his remarkable bestseller ""How We Die,"" Sherwin Nuland rails at the ""soulless summary'' of the death certificate. He finds it ridiculous and dishonest that ""government statisticians and the scientific clinicians insist that proper names must be applied to sluggish circulation and an antique heart.''   To the C.D.C., a cause of death might be cardiac arrest, precipitated by a gastric hemorrhage, which in turn was the result of an ulcer. Or something more challenging to decode: a rupture of the myocardium caused by acute myocardial infarction, caused by coronary artery thrombosis and underlying atherosclerotic coronary heart disease.   But being old isn't the same as having a heart attack. Frail, weak, bedridden old people don't get cured, ever. ""To call a natural process by the name of a disease is the first step in an attempt to cure it and thereby thwart it,'' Dr. Nuland writes.   Plus, the ""biomedical world view'' distorts what actually happens. Veins and arteries stiffen and narrow. Less blood flows to the brain. Neurons die. Bones get brittle. Tiny strokes leave big deficits. Infections have their way once the immune system is shot. Sometimes all of the above happen, usually at least three.   When a person dies, calling the cause heart disease or pneumonia or osteoporosis or vascular dementia is both arbitrary and beside the point. In fact, everything stops working because the time is up. ""The thing that peters out,'' Dr. Nuland writes, ""is nothing other than the life force.""  What would it mean to medical science, I wonder, if death certificates did not describe us all as dying of something that could have been treated, and perhaps was, but instead of something inevitable and universally shared? Can we really pursue new treatments for heart disease or diabetes without also directly addressing their most frequent cause: age itself? And what would it mean for public policy if the leading cause of death among the very old was ""wheels falling off bicycle""? Would long-term care, its costs and indignities, find a place on the national agenda?   Dr. Nuland describes the very old in death as ""shrunken,'' and I can attest to that. My mother was tiny and crumpled, the light gone from her eyes. She died of old age, no matter what the death certificate says. ",[]

(Photo: Kate Blumm/Brooklyn Botanic Garden))    A rare orchid the size of a Volkswagen Beetle is blooming for the second time ever at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, a blessed event that has spurred envy among the handful of orchid growers who will even try to grow a plant this big.  Considered ""The Queen of Orchidaceous Plants,"" and one of the world's largest orchids, this particular Grammatophyllum speciosum is 12 feet in diameter and weighs about 200 pounds. It last bloomed in 2003 and has four huge flower spikes, at least one of which should remain in bloom for the next week or two, said David Horak, curator of the garden's orchid collection.  Known as the tiger or leopard orchid, the plant is native to Malaysia, Sumatra and New Guinea, where it grows in the crotches of trees more than 100 feet in the air. Plants can weigh up to two tons.   ""There are all kinds of anecdotal stories about workers being killed trying to remove one from a tree,"" Mr. Horak said.  If it is rare in nature, this Gulliver of the garden world is even rarer in captivity, because very few people or institutions can afford to grow it.  Mr. Horak bought the plant 10 years ago for $75 at an auction from the widow of Don Richardson, who was the orchid grower for Greentree, the Whitney estate on Long Island. It now hangs in a 30-inch square basket, 15 feet in the air above a pond in the Robert W. Wilson Aquatic House, part of the Steinhardt Conservatory.   As plants go, it is fairly high-maintenance, he said. It is watered every sunny day, and fed two or three times a week.     The last time we potted it, it took five people and a rope and pulley to lower it into the current basket. They resent being repotted, and for some time after we repotted it, it kind of sulked. It didn't grow very well for a couple years.  In an August 2007 article in Orchids, the bulletin of the American Orchid Society, Erich E. Michel, the operations manager of the Hoosier Orchid Company in Indianapolis, describes trying to get a Grammatophyllum to bloom. In the essay, titled ""I Need to Grow a Giant Orchid"" (a need his wife as defined as ""childish competitive dementia""), he described trying to coax blooms from the plant, which he variously refers to as ""the beast"" and ""the monster.""   (Photo: The orchid is about 12 feet in diameter and weighs about 200 pounds. At least one flower spike should remain in bloom for a week or two. (Photo: Kate Blumm/Brooklyn Botanic Garden))   The plant's spiny rootlets, which dry and harden until they are thornlike, catch plant and animal litter from above and form ""a self-made composter"" that helps feed the plant.  ""These barbed roots were just one way the plant could hurt you,"" he writes, then describes how, after nine years of waiting, the growers decided to force the plant to bloom, by starving it. ""We were going to make it think it was going to die,"" he wrote.   He succeeded in 2004, and again in 2007, when the plant produced eight flower spikes. That year, he decided to move it to the Garfield Park Conservatory in Indianapolis, which required four people to hold the pot and three to hold the plant's stems.   The Brooklyn orchid's next feat will be to produce a seed capsule the size of a Nerf football, Mr. Horak said. It will have about two million dustlike seeds in it, which may be offered to a commercial firm or other institution that wants to try growing its own. The seeds are considered an aphrodisiac in some circles, Mr. Michel wrote.  Unlike Audrey II, the voracious plant from ""The Little Shop of Horrors,"" the Brooklyn plant has not been named, Mr. Horak said.   ""On any given day, if it's creating trouble, it gets names nobody wants to hear,"" he said. ",[]

129,dementia,2008,The New York Times,"At Last, Bernstein Meets Deep Throat","At Last, Bernstein Meets Deep Throat","The Watergate investigation changed history and spawned thousands of journalism careers, but until Sunday Carl Bernstein had never met the secret source known as Deep Throat.","(Photo: Clockwise from right: Bob Woodward, Mark Felt, Carl Bernstein and John O'Connor, Mr. Felt's co-author on ""A G-Man's Life"" (Photo: Joan Felt)) Updated During all the months that Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward spent cracking the Watergate scandal, and in all the years since, Mr. Bernstein had never met the reporters' most famous source, the man known as Deep Throat.  Until now.  Last Sunday, 36 years after the two young Washington Post reporters began writing about a botched burglary at the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate building in Washington, both men paid a visit to Mark Felt, whom they had dubbed Deep Throat, at his Santa Rosa, Calif., home.  Mr. Felt was the No. 2 man at the F.B.I., with intimate knowledge of the White House and the re-election campaign of President Richard M. Nixon, when Mr. Woodward began consulting him about the un-spooling Watergate story.  Mr. Bernstein was never privy to those meetings, and for nearly four decades never met the man who guided them through the investigation that ultimately linked Mr. Nixon and his closest White House aides to the break-in and cover-up. Two years later, their work led to the threat of impeachment, forcing Mr. Nixon to resign.  But late Sunday afternoon, Mr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein met with Mr. Felt at his home on -- wait for it -- Redford Place in Santa Rosa, 55 miles north of San Francisco.   Mr. Felt, 95, suffers from dementia, but Mr. Bernstein said during their visit he had moments of clarity. The man who told them the truth when so many others had obfuscated and lied ""was engaged,"" Mr. Woodward said.   The two journalists were heading to the bay area for a talk at the Lesher Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek. Mr. Woodward said that in the back of their minds was the thought that this would be an opportunity to swing by for a visit to Mr. Felt, who has been in failing health. Joan, his daughter and caregiver, had warned that in the last few months he had almost died, Mr. Woodward said. So, he said, he and Mr. Bernstein agreed to fly west a day early to finally introduce Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Felt.  The meeting, late Sunday in the family living room, included neighbors, family members and friends of the Felts. ""It was like a family reunion,"" Mr. Woodward said, ""a festive family gathering."" Guests sipped iced tea as a few friendly dogs meandered about, he said.   Mr. Felt wore a white shirt -– ""like a good FBI man,"" Mr. Woodward said -- and a red blazer, which was not so much like an FBI man. Ms. Felt has said that her father has memories of two people: J. Edgar Hoover and Mr. Woodward.   The two reporters revealed the meeting Monday night, at the Walnut Creek speaking event, and Mr. Bernstein described it as ""a remarkable afternoon.""   ""We were there to pay our respects and gratitude and we conveyed that,"" Mr. Bernstein said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ""It was heartfelt and was received that way.""   Both he and Mr. Woodward described Mr. Felt as having ""great dignity and grace"" including, Mr. Bernstein said, ""in his words.""  ""It was a personal visit, not a working visit,"" he said, ""and it closed the circle.""  Deep Throat's identity had been kept secret for decades, as part of Mr. Woodward's journalistic pledge to Mr. Felt, and it became the source of great speculation. It was not until June 2005 that the public learned his identity, and even then it was not Mr. Woodward who disclosed the information but Mr. Felt in an article in Vanity Fair.   The relationship was fraught with mystery, vividly captured in a book and a movie, ""All the President's Men,"" (Robert Redford played Mr. Woodward and Dustin Hoffman played Mr. Bernstein, with Hal Holbrook playing the shadowy Deep Throat). The book described Mr. Woodward planting a red flag in a flower pot on the window sill of his apartment to signal to his source that they needed to meet. Deep Throat signaled his desire to talk by circling page 20 on Mr. Woodward's New York Times. They rendezvoused at an underground garage.   In a phone interview Wednesday, Mr. Woodward recalled Mr. Felt's importance to the investigation.   ""He provided confirmation and guidance and directed us,"" Mr. Woodward said. ""Here he is in an important position in the FBI. What he conveyed was the magnitude of Watergate, the way Nixon operated and that there were lots of tentacles and that it went to the top and that it was a concerted effort of political espionage to beat the Democrats in '72. And they did.""  ""It gave us comfort that it was not just the people we were talking to at the mid-level and low-level -- we had dozens of sources -- it was somebody at the crossroads of the investigation.""   Despite hundreds of speculative stories about Deep Throat's identity Mr. Woodward said today, ""Like all secrets, sometimes we hide it in plain sight.""   Mr. Woodward said an article headlined, ""FBI Finds Nixon Aides Sabotaged Democrats,"" in the Washington Post on Oct. 10, 1972, gave a major clue about the source, but few Watergate sleuths noticed. The hint was buried in the lead:  ""FBI agents have established that the Watergate bugging incident stemmed from a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage conducted on behalf of President Nixon's re-election and directed by officials of the White House and the Committee for the Re-election of the President…""    ",[]
130,dementia,2008,The New York Times,Where the Mommy Track Crosses the Daughter Track,Where the Mommy Track Crosses the Daughter Track,Workplace accommodations modeled on child care do not always benefit employees caring for aging parents.,"Since the late 1960s and early 1970s, when working women made child care benefits a key part of the feminist agenda, it has become routine for companies to provide maternity leaves, job sharing and pre-tax accounts to pay for child care. These days, the accommodations offered to those of us caring for elderly parents often are modeled on these kinds of child care benefits. But the so-called ""mommy track"" and ""daughter track"" are more dissimilar than similar, and the child care paradigm does not always work to benefit adult caregivers.   For instance, most pregnant workers know when they will take maternity leave and for how long. But someone responsible for an aged parent faces an unpredictable series of crises. When the unexpected happens, the caregiver must use some of the time off granted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act or depend on the good will of a supervisor.  Or take flexible spending accounts, which permit the use of pre-tax dollars for dependent care. I.R.S. regulations require that the dependent receive full financial support and live with the employee. That is generally the case with children, but rarely with elderly parents.   Perhaps it's no surprise, then, that corporate America is losing billions of dollars because of the soaring number of employees whose responsibilities for elderly parents result in absenteeism, lost productivity, premature retirement, stress-related health problems and other consequences of attending to unpredictable crises during working hours.   These costs have been calculated by the MetLife Mature Market Institute, along with the National Alliance for Caregiving, and the bad news predictably is getting worse as the population ages. In 1997, overall costs to employers ranged from $11.5 billion to $29 billion a year, depending on how many hours a week of hands-on care employees were providing. By 2006, both numbers had jumped by more than $4 billion a year; costs ranged from $17.1 billion to $33.6 billion and are still rising.  Here are some examples of ways that employers are impacted when workers are torn between jobs and caregiving, and as a result reduce their hours, retire early, or suffer both mentally and physically from the stress.   * The cost of replacing experienced employees who quit: $6.6 billion in 2006, up from $4.9 billion in 1997.  * Workday interruptions: $6.3 billion in 2006, up from $3.7 billion in 1997.  * Absenteeism: $2.5 billion in 2009, up from $885 million in 1997.   (Using from a simple online tool, employers can estimate how much money they are losing based on the size of a business, the average hourly wage and the number of employees with caregiving responsibilities.)   Reducing those costs will require companies to rethink many of the options they offer to employees. One benefit with real utility for caregivers is back-up care, usually provided by a company under contract with an employer. Any time an employee has a temporary need for child care or eldercare -- say, a sick babysitter or a home health aide who fails to show up -- he or she can get a temporary replacement, by the next morning, by making one phone call. The cost of the replacement care generally is subsidized by the employer.  One of the nation's leading providers of back-up care is the Work Options Group , based in Superior, Colo., whose clients include Microsoft, Verizon Wireless, Princeton University and Prudential Financial. This year, Work Options will serve 600,000 employees, a 30 percent increase in just two years. But according to C.E.O. Cindy Carrillo, 90 percent of the employees using the service are mothers (and some fathers), rather than daughters (and some sons).  I asked Ms. Carrillo why this was so, given the number of employees nationwide with responsibility for aging parents. (Estimates range from 16 to 20 million.) On explanation, she said, is the average age of employees at the companies she works with: 35 to 37 years old at high-tech or telecommunications concerns, and 45 to 47 years old in more old-line businesses. In either case, she said, they are more likely to have young children than dependent parents.   But numbers tell only a small part of the story. Those on the mommy track, she added, are far more comfortable seeking help from their human resource departments and far more likely, now as in the past, to press for what they need if they're not getting it. And few companies want to be seen as politically incorrect regarding child care.   By contrast, Ms. Carrillo said, those caring for parents (as she is) tend to hold their situations together with ""rubber bands and bubble gum'' and keep their problems to themselves -- knowing from experience that some bosses and colleagues avert their eyes or change the subject when talk turns to incontinence or dementia.   Ms. Carrillo noted, too, that few of us plan in advance for the time and money we may have to spend on eldercare, arguably because we don't want to think about it and are hoping it will never come up. Compare that to the elaborate preparation for the arrival of a new baby, Ms. Carrillo said, including child care arrangements and college savings accounts. Denial, then, affects how workers use these benefits even when they are offered.   ""We close one eye, look the other way, handle one hurdle at a time and don't realize how much trouble we're in until it accelerates,'' Ms. Carrillo said.  This mindset may account for the absence of activism among caregivers of the elderly, who have not made their voices heard as working mothers did decades ago.   ""Nobody wants to think about it beforehand,'' Ms. Carrillo said. ""When you're in the throes of it you don't have time. And when you're done, you don't want to go back there again.'' ",[]
149,dementia,2008,The New York Times,Guide to Assisted Living,10 Things to Know About Assisted Living,"Dr. Cheryl Woodson, an experienced geriatrician, offers some advice on navigating the caregiving maze.","Dr. Cheryl Woodson, you may recall from last week's post, is a seasoned geriatrician in Chicago Heights, Ill., who has found that she can no longer afford to accept new Medicare patients.   She is also a blunt and funny woman who liberally dispenses wisdom to her elderly patients and their adult children, and herself a daughter who cared for her own mother with Alzheimer's disease for a decade. Here's some of Dr. Woodson's advice on navigating the caregiving maze, which I culled both from her book, ""To Survive Caregiving,"" and from observing her during a recent day-long visit to her office.   (Photo: Dr. Cheryl Woodson, geriatrician and author of ""To Survive Caregiving."" (Sally Ryan for The New York Times))   1. Assisted living, a popular solution for elderly people who cannot live independently, is a ""myth,"" Dr. Woodson said, ""a place for people who don't exist."" Families often believe these facilities will meet all of their loved ones' needs, enabling caregivers to focus on jobs and family, only to find this isn't the case. Before long, the elderly resident will require more than ""meals you don't have to cook, grass you don't have to cut and socialization,'' Dr. Woodson said. At that point the elderly resident is in trouble, since assisted living facilities are not permitted by law to provide medical care and consider it to be the family's responsibility.   2. Squaring a family's expectations with those legal limits would require a thorough, first-hand assessment of the elderly person's physical and cognitive health before admission to an assisted living facility. That rarely happens. New residents are admitted based on a report from their current physicians, who may not be qualified to diagnose the early signs of dementia and impending immobility or may sugarcoat the situation in order to help a desperate family. ""They just need a little help,'' the usual rationale for accepting elderly prospects into assisted living, is ridiculous on its face, Dr. Woodson said. ""If they just needed a little help, they'd still be in the community.""   3. Instead, without verifying the physician's report or the family's representations, these facilities may admit residents who already need help with simple tasks like dressing or eating, or will in the very near future, and then charge extra for these services. Some do this to fill empty beds; others give residency a shot as a kindness to desperate families, Dr. Woodson said. But when the resident declines, as all of them will unless they die suddenly, more and more a la carte services mean a bigger and bigger monthly bill, or more and more work for family members who expected the opposite.  4. Coordinating all the services that the assisted living facility doesn't provide generally falls to one sibling, Dr. Woodson noted, who then becomes overwhelmed, sacrificing more than should be expected. The solution is hiring a geriatric care manager -- ""They should be called rent-a-daughters,'' Dr. Woodson said -- adding further to the expense, until the resident and family can no longer afford this kind of accommodation and are forced to consider a nursing home.  5. Most families balk at the prospect of transferring an aging parent to a nursing home because they like the aesthetics of assisted living -- the carpeted floors, overstuffed chairs and crystal chandeliers. But without round-the-clock care, many residents are ""as alone at night as if they were in their own homes,'' Dr. Woodson said. Other families are unwilling to break a promise to Mom or Dad never to put them in a nursing home. The spirit of that promise -- to give a parent the best possible care -- is what matters, Dr. Woodson said, ""and sometimes that means not doing it yourself.'' An aging parent's condition may eventually require three shifts of nurses and aides, not a family member trying to take care of everything 24/7.  6. The doctors who see residents at assisted living facilities are essentially freelancers, not employees, since their fees are paid by Medicare and they also may maintain private practices. So rather than hang around the facility expecting them to answer your questions on the fly, Dr. Woodson suggested calling and arranging to see them ""by appointment, not by ambush.'' This consultation will not be covered by Medicare unless it coincides with a medical procedure for the resident. Still, it is essential in order to stay on top of an elderly person's medications, some of which may be unnecessary and even dangerous, and to make decisions about which medical care improves the quality of life and which is pointless and wasteful.  7. If a parent lives in an assisted living facility, families should closely monitor the monthly pharmacy bill, less for cost than for content. Is Xanax being prescribed for anxiety? There are numerous other remedies available without the potentially dangerous side effects. What about muscle relaxants for arthritic pain? They increase confusion in the elderly and add to the risk of falls; instead, ask for pain medication and/or a heating pad. If the assisted living facility offers to have prescriptions filled and delivered by a local pharmacy -- a huge convenience for family members -- be sure it's a pharmacy that insists upon periodic blood work or other tests for drugs that are supposed to be closely monitored.  8. The goal of medical care for the elderly, in Dr. Woodson's view and the view of every geriatrician I've ever interviewed, is to make day-to-day life more comfortable, not to cure illness or extend longevity. Examples? A joint replacement to relieve pain and improve mobility makes sense only if the patient has the cognitive ability to complete physical therapy. Otherwise, he or she will never walk again and would be better off avoiding surgery and simply being kept comfortable. Similarly, anyone who would refuse cancer treatment because of advanced age probably doesn't need a mammogram, Pap smear or colonoscopy. ""Why draw a map to someplace we know we're not going?'' Dr. Woodson asked.  9. Apply similar standards to immunizations and vaccinations. If someone is so ill or disabled that death would be welcome, refuse the vaccine for pneumonia, long known as ""the old person's friend.'' But never say no to the shingles vaccine, which can prevent an excruciating rash. ""Even if someone was only going to live five more minutes, that's the one thing I'd suggest,'' Dr. Woodson says. ""It's a quality-of-life issue.''  10. Do not assume that the presenting symptom of Alzheimer's disease will be forgetting words, losing things or other obvious examples of short-term memory loss. Often the first thing a family member will notice is an empty checking account, Dr. Woodson said, because a normally cautious and frugal person has been tricked by a get-rich-quick scheme or other scam. And like missing money, look out for pills missing from those seven-day dispensers that help people with multiple medications keep track of what they're taking and when. Family members may find the dispensers empty and worry about overdose, Dr. Woodson noted, but often the missing pills will turn up under couch cushions or scattered elsewhere around the house. Take this as a cue that it may be time for a cognitive assessment. ",[]
166,dementia,2008,The New York Times,Advice on End-of-Life Care,What an End-of-Life Adviser Could Have Told Me,Advice on end-of-life care that could have eased my mother’s last days.,"(Photo: Jane Gross's mother, Estelle Gross, at a nursing home in Riverdale, N.Y., in 2002.)   If only I'd had the 800 number for Compassion & Choices in the last difficult months of my mother's life. She was paralyzed, incontinent and unable to speak. I watched the light leave her eyes and her body crumple like a rag doll's, and I knew that one day soon she would say, ""Enough.''   During this period, my mother and I talked and talked and talked about her end-of-life choices, as we had for many years. A decade earlier the conversation had seemed totally academic, even a bit weird. But now we were both grateful that this was familiar territory. At regular family meetings at the nursing home where she lived, the social workers, nurses and doctors joined what had been our private dialog. Our willingness to look my mother's certain death squarely in the eye, they said, was both unusual in families and beneficial to her quality of life.   Despite my mother's helplessness and misery those last months, she wasn't dying of anything. She had a garden-variety set of ailments for an 87-year-old woman: high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, an inner-ear disturbance. A series of imperceptible strokes, known as T.I.A.'s, had left her body useless. But they didn't necessarily portend a deadly event. She'd dodged the bullets of cancer, serious heart or pulmonary disease, and dementia. It is not uncommon, having lived past 85, to keep on living for a very long time -- ""healthy'' in the narrow sense of the word, but increasingly incapacitated. That, alas, was my mother's fate.   She often longed for the oblivion of Alzheimer's disease. But her sharp mind -- she never skipped a beat -- entitled her to organize her own death, within legal limits, which she did by deciding to stop food and hydration. We had discussed and researched this option, and we had read enough to be reasonably confident this manner of dying was not a frightful ordeal but rather a gentle death. We trusted that an enlightened nursing home like the one she was in wouldn't force her to eat and drink. They had readily accepted earlier decisions to forgo diagnostic tests or hospitalizations, and later antibiotics for pneumonia.   Our study of what is known as V.S.E.D., or ""voluntarily stopping eating and drinking,"" was impressive for amateurs, if I do say so myself. My mother had a pretty good death, on her own terms, and we had the nursing home's full support. I'm proud and grateful to have been able to advocate for her and to have been by her side. That said, there were several rough patches. And after recently meeting Judy Schwarz, the patient support coordinator for Compassion & Choices in New York, I now can see we'd have had an easier time of it had she been along for the ride.   What follows are a few of the bumps in the road that I bet would have been smoothed with her expert guidance.   * Medical professionals can only guess how long it takes to die of dehydration. (Merely refusing food is a bad idea, as many people who have gone on long hunger strikes can surely attest.) My mother's nurses and doctors said she'd likely last four, five, six days -- a week at most. With that in mind, I settled into a recliner in her room with books, music, snacks and a few changes of clothes, and I intended to stay by her side, as promised, for the duration.   In fact, she lived for 13 days, alert and communicative for about a week and manifesting none of the signs of impending death until the last 36 to 48 hours. Why the discrepancy? People in my mother's robust condition rarely make this choice. It is typically how people die in the end stages of cancer or Alzheimer's disease, following a progressive loss of interest or ability to eat and drink -- not an abrupt dinner-yesterday-but-no-breakfast-today-thank-you-very-much announcement. I don't know if my mother experienced time as I did, but to me it felt interminable. To my shame, I did a lot of clock-watching. Eventually I went home at night, leaving behind a private-duty aide.   I doubt I'd have twitched with impatience, just wanting for it to be over, had I known that the average dying time is two to three weeks, as the scientific literature says. Judy Schwarz would have told me that. I think the days would have been more peaceful and contemplative had I not been surprised by how long it took.   * Several of my mother's caregivers, both nurses and aides, had moral or religious reservations about her decision. To their credit, they didn't just switch to the other side of the floor. They came to me, in tears, to say this was something their consciences would not permit. They visited her several times a day, but delegated the hands-on responsibilities to others. At the time, I admired their honesty and felt their hurt and love, but I wondered if this behavior was appropriate. Shouldn't they be able to leave their personal convictions at home?   The answer, I now know, is that they followed the canons of their profession perfectly: no health professional is required to participate if that violates a personal belief system. What they are required to do is ensure a smooth hand-off to someone equally qualified.   * During and after my mother's death, I was often stung by the implied or expressed judgments of friends, colleagues and even strangers after I wrote about the experience. ""You let your mother do that?,'' I was frequently asked, with the word ""let'' heavy with opprobrium. My answer, generally, was that it wasn't up to me. She was mentally competent and entitled to do as she pleased. My job as her daughter was to be supportive. Left unsaid, once I'd experienced the first episodes of shock and disapproval, was that I totally agreed with her. Expecting the reaction of others would have helped.   * Once my mother began her fast, the nursing home offered two ways to ensure her comfort. The regular staff could stay in place, keeping her mouth from getting too dry and administering sedatives as needed under the supervision of a palliative care physician. Or a team of hospice professionals, part of what was then a new collaboration with the nursing home, could take their places at the bedside. I opted for the familiar. My mother didn't warm easily to strangers, and I thought she would need the comfort of people she knew well.   A counselor like Ms. Schwarz would have told me that the regulars might ask to be taken off the case, which might have changed my mind. She also would have told me that a hospice team likely would medicate my mother more aggressively, given their training in cutting-edge comfort care. Even if I'd stuck to my plan and later wished I'd chosen hospice, Ms. Schwarz would have suggested a change of course. It never occurred to me that was possible. I was too tired to think straight.  * I have always assumed that what my mother chose to do herself, I could have insisted upon for her, as her health care proxy. In other words, if she were no longer ""decisionally capable,'' though not on the brink of death, I could have told the staff to stop spooning food into her mouth or bringing the straw to her lips, and they would have listened to me as her surrogate. Ms. Schwarz would have told me this isn't so. Other end-of-life experts are less certain but know of no test cases. From that I conclude that V.S.E.D. should be considered a viable option only for cognitively intact men and women. Maybe that's why it's called ""voluntarily stopping eating and drinking.''   To arrange for an end-of-life consultation with Compassion & Choices, with chapters nationwide, call 800-247-7421. ",[]
183,dementia,2008,The New York Times,Reading the Family Narrative…Backwards,Reading the Family Narrative…Backwards,More on what geriatric care managers can do for caregiving families.,"Geriatric care manager Pat Mulvey answers more questions about how professionals like herself interact with family caregivers. -- Jane Gross   Caregivers are told all the time that they must look after themselves. But in my experience knowing what you should do doesn't mean you can actually do it. How do you carve out time for yourself if you have a job and/or children? And how can you use that time most restoratively?   Self-care means different things to different people. I've found that to take care of oneself doesn't necessarily mean a day at a spa -- although that would be nice! Some days it means to remember to inhale and exhale. Sometimes just listening to soft music while lying on your bed and concentrating on your breath can be restorative. Self-care can mean getting a good night's sleep, eating right, remembering to laugh at something (anything!) during the day. Sometimes M&M's help! A short walk outside, maybe around the block, at least gives a caregiver a change of scenery, some fresh air and the empowered feeling that you are not a hostage to caring for your loved one.  If you do have help in caring for your loved one, let them do what they are hired to do! Use that time to go to the library to sit quietly; go for lunch with a friend, or go shopping. One of my friends uses the time she has help in caring for her mother to go to a department store and try on fancy dresses.   It's also very helpful to consider adult cay care programs. There are many day centers where transportation is provided, meals and snacks are available, and the elder has the opportunity to socialize with others. There are medical model day centers and social day centers. A care manager can help you to identify what might be best and how to pay for it. There are centers that operate during the day, and centers that operate in the evening and overnight hours. The latter can be especially helpful when the elder's disease process has altered his or her internal clock.  Respite is another wonderful option for caregivers. Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals may have beds set aside for this. The elder can stay at the facility for a period of time and be cared for 24 hours per day. This gives family members an opportunity to take a vacation, have some down time and regroup. Your care manager can help explain and identify where these centers are in your community.   No criticism intended, but this is all pretty standard advice both from friends and professionals. But often caregivers can't or won't peel themselves away. When an adult child, especially a daughter, refuses to delegate anything and runs herself into the ground, what is going on emotionally or within the family that makes it impossible for her to back off a little?   This is an area where family history plays a huge part in how we respond to the caregiving role. If part of the family lore or story is that grandmother took care of eight children under the age of 7 while also taking care of both her aging parents and working as a seamstress while her husband worked in the mines -- that becomes ingrained in us each time the story is repeated, and the story takes on different meanings in each of the listeners, like the childhood game of telephone.  Geriatric care managers usually come into the story in the last chapters. These are longstanding relationships between mother and daughter, mother and son, father and daughter or son, and we have just picked up the book and are reading it backwards. A lifetime of experiences have occurred, and it's highly unlikely we'll know the depth and intricacies of these relationships in the time we get to work with the family.  But we strive to build a safe, trusting relationship with the caregivers. We listen carefully to fully assess what they are saying -- and as importantly, what they are not saying -- to identify the history behind the choices that are being made. Geriatric care managers are skilled at being able to identify driving forces that even the child is not conscious of. Sometimes understanding why we're behaving the way we are can help the caregiver look at the situation differently. In working with both the elder and the caregiver, we can weave the story together and provide the interpretation of the tale in a way that will help the family deal with the here and now.  And we shouldn't forget about the spouse as caregiver. Very often the aging caregiver spouse does not want to accept help or suggestions from his or her children, which means the children are in a more difficult position as they are trying to protect and care for both parents. Many times, the spouse caregiver is more open to suggestions from an outsider than they are from their own children.   Can you compare the caregiving experience and the role of a geriatric case manager when the elderly person is suffering from physical frailty versus a dementing illness? Many of us assume that nothing is harder than being responsible for someone with AIzheimer's. Is this true, or are the frail equally hard but in different ways?  I think caring for a loved one with either physical frailty or a dementia is very difficult, because it forces us to think about our own mortality. On the one hand, caring for one who is frail to the point where they need assistance with some or all of their activities of daily living -- everything from feeding themselves to dressing, toileting and bathing -- is very hard for family members. It prompts enormous emotional responses when you are feeding your parent who used to feed you, or bathing and doing other personal care for a loved one.  On the other hand, watching a parent and loved one loose his or her memory and identity is frustrating and difficult. When the loved one looks the same yet can't remember who you are, it's difficult to grapple with. When they ask the same question over and over again, it's easy to lose your temper, to think they have some control over the situation or they are just doing this to annoy you. Neither could be further from the truth, yet it's difficult to understand that the part of the brain that stores and retrieves this information is damaged and the loved one is unable to even be aware of it. It's hard to understand that although Dad can still do the crossword puzzle, he can't remember your name.  Tell us the main challenges siblings face in collaborating in a parent's care. Is the division of labor ever equal? What happens when one can afford to help out financially and the others can't? Or when one is capable and responsible and the others are not? I suspect gender and proximity are the key factors in who winds up the child-in-charge, not necessarily closeness to the parent. But what role does closeness play?   In my family, for instance, my mother and brother were soul mates, which I think made it much easier for her to talk about hard end-of-life stuff with me. Our distance, ironically, seemed an advantage. And what can you tell us about sibling conflict near the end of life? What if one child has the proxy and the other disagrees with decisions being made? Do you do what you think Mom or Dad would want at the expense of a lifelong sibling relationship?   It's so hard to generalize, because each family has its own dynamics. Geriatric care managers usually see that it is a daughter or daughter-in-law who is the primary caregiver, whether they live nearby or at a distance. And it depends on which sibling or family member you ask if the division of labor is ever equal.  Someone often feels they are doing more than the others. This also goes back to the history within the family, the mom-always-liked-you-best childhood jealousies that get triggered. How a family system has functioned in the past is indicative of how it will function at this tough time. A family meeting is imperative.  Many times, the children all live a long distance from the parents. In this case, we identify what needs to be done and the care manager will arrange to do it or have it done by a para-professional. If the children are able to and want to divide the care, we schedule a meeting with all the siblings to review the tasks that need to be addressed.   We get the children to look at what support each one of them can deliver according to their strengths and resources, and then we offer suggestions. While daughter number three might be the best to do the cooking and the shopping, the fact that she lives four hours away removes that option on a regular basis. Perhaps she can come monthly, do shopping and prepare some meals to freeze. Having a third party work with the children to develop the task list and the responsibility list and to keep the delegation of tasks on track is enormously beneficial.  Once we've hashed out the responsibilities, the tasks and the time schedule for them to be done, we write it all up in different formats. One is a list of the tasks by individual: Mary has five things to do, Sally has four but one will consume more time or resources. Bill has seven things to do on a regular basis, but he lives with Mom and this works best. We spend significant time on this aspect of a family meeting. I try to get all the issues out on the table so they can be talked about as a group with an independent ""referee.""  We also write it up as a calendar, so that all can see exactly what is expected every day for a month. That helps everyone to plan their other responsibilities around the caregiving tasks. If a change to the schedule or calendar needs to be made, the individual lets the care manager know and we negotiate with the others to meet the change. We can sometimes avoid old jealousies by being the clearinghouse and the keeper of the calendar.  In our family meetings, we counsel the family about issues that may come up, end-of-life decisions that may not be agreed by all, and who has the actual decision-making authority. We are the independent third party that each can vent to, and we help the family come as close to consensus as possible. Parents have individual relationships with each of their children when the children become adults. While it's impossible to identify why certain choices are made by the parent, by counseling the children individually and in a group, we hope to be able to lead them into acceptance of the choices and to help them to work together. I always tell the family, ""Call me if you want to vent about your brother or sister before you call them."" We may be able to provide a different perspective and avert a deep argument. ",[]

43,dementia,2009,The New York Times,When It Isn’t Really Senility,When It Isn&#39;t Really Senility,"Many cases of so-called dementia are reversible, experts say.","When Jane Simpson's mother, then 91, started showing signs of memory loss in December 2007, Ms. Simpson thought age had finally caught up with her. ""As this had been a gradual process, and considering her age, we were not unduly alarmed — just saddened that it seemed we were losing my mother mentally,"" she wrote in an e-mail to this blog.  But on a visit six months later, Ms. Simpson, a 61-year-old advertising copywriter in North Carolina, was struck by how much worse her mother's memory loss had become and by her confusion about everything happening around her.  Just typical 91-year-old behavior? Just the first signs of the inevitable slide toward dementia we all may face if we live long enough? Not at all.  Since the '70s, geriatric specialists have been aware of many unusual causes of memory loss, confusion and disorientation in older people. These include not just medical conditions ranging from urinary tract infection to hydrocephalus to the flu, but also side effects from many commonly used medications.   Often, doctors and family members disregard these symptoms, thinking that they are just signs of an inevitable age-related decline. But many cases of pseudo-senility, as it's called, are reversible — if they are caught early enough.   By coincidence, Ms. Simpson had recently read a short article in her local newspaper about the side effects in the elderly of a bladder control drug called Ditropan, which include severe memory loss. Her mother was taking Ditropan.  Ms. Simpson and her sister got their mother switched to an alternative bladder control drug, Enablex. Sure enough, her mental symptoms eased. ""Within three months,"" Ms. Simpson recalled in her e-mail, ""we felt that we had our mother back.""   You'd think that with the constant attention being paid to Alzheimer's disease and other causes of memory loss in aging, doctors would have learned by now that severe memory loss in healthy aging is a problem to be diagnosed, not an inevitability to be lived with and accepted.   But according to the National Institute on Aging, missed diagnoses of reversible dementia still occur too often. ""Some physical and mental changes occur with age in healthy people,"" the agency writes in a publication called ""Forgetfulness."" ""However, much pain and suffering can be avoided if older people, their families, and their doctors recognize dementia as a disease, not part of normal aging.""  Reversible causes of dementia include the side effects of many medications. Ditropan is only the most recent addition to the list, occasioned in part by a study by U.S. Navy neurologist Dr. Jack Tsao involving 870 men and women with an average age of 75. The subjects, who were all Catholic priests, nuns and brothers, were followed for almost eight years. At a 2008 meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, Dr. Tsao reported that those who were taking anticholinergic drugs — a class that includes not only Detrol but also drugs to treat hypertension, asthma and Parkinson's disease — had a 50 percent higher rate of cognitive decline than those who were not.  According to Dr. Samuel Gandy, a neurologist at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan, drugs with antihistamines often cause mental confusion and sedation in the elderly — especially those containing the antihistamine doxylamine, such as the sleep aid Unisom. In addition, confusion and forgetfulness in the elderly can be caused by malnutrition, chronic alcoholism and metabolic disturbances such as thyroid, kidney or liver disorders — and even on occasion by something as common as dehydration or a high fever.  Doctors are better than they used to be at diagnosing pseudosenility, according to Dr. Gandy. ""Most physicians are taught in medical schools to evaluate a patient for dementia by first excluding the reversible causes,"" he said.   But one kind remains a particular problem, he added: depression masquerading as dementia. Doctors can't simply order a test to rule it out; the best they can do is recommend a trial run of antidepressant therapy, he said, ""to see if the person will perk up and come back.""   First, though, the physician must think of something other than aging as a possible cause of the symptoms.  ",[]

With a family history of Alzheimer's disease, even occasional lapses in memory cause her to worry.)   This morning I couldn't remember the street number of my house. My own house! Don't panic, I thought, don't struggle to remember it. Just go on with other things, and it'll float to the surface. But it didn't, so I opened the front door and read the street numbers aloud, trying to fix them in my brain.  Lots of people have these lapses, I know. But one week ago, I was sitting with my mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, in a memory care center in Honolulu. We were in the ""living room"" filled with 20 Benjamin Buttons, 20 people aging backward, regressing to infancy. Not in body, as in the movie, but in mind.   One woman who'd been a political journalist sat hugging a teddy bear. ""What is your full name?"" a nurses' assistant asked the group. Half of them shook their heads, baffled. My mother remembers her name but sometimes thinks I'm her older sister. She seems happy, though, as she eats dinner with the group in silence before they're herded to the parlor to watch a DVD of ""The Parent Trap."" She's not suffering, but I am, feeling heartsick every time I drive away.   Not only my mother but both her parents had dementia and were institutionalized. So when I have a lapse like today's, I ask myself, ""Is it starting?""   There's a blood test one can take that shows if you carry a gene that's a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Should I take it? My gut reaction is no, since there's no cure or way to prevent the disease.  Nonetheless, I do research on the genetics of Alzheimer's. According to a report by the Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center, no gene has been identified as the cause of late-onset Alzheimer's, which occurs after 60. (That's not late for this reporter; it's now!) But one genetic risk factor has been confirmed by many studies to increase the likelihood of developing the disease. That risk factor is the gene variant APOE4, found on chromosome 19. If you carry this variant, you're more prone to develop Alzheimer's disease -- 40 percent of people with the disease have APOE4, according to the report.  On the other hand, you may not develop Alzheimer's even if you test positive for APOE4, and if you don't carry the gene, you still may contract the disease.  I make a list of the pro's and con's of testing for APOE4.  PRO:  1. Information is power. Dr. Lenny Guarente, a biology professor at M.I.T. who studies genes that may determine how long we live, says people who test positive for APOE4 often ""handle the information well."" Many prefer to know and adjust to the fact than live with doubts.  2. You can make plans. During my yearly physical, I told my doctor I'm worried about memory loss because dementia runs in my family. He suggested I tell my children how I'd want to be cared for if the need should arise. Ideally, I'd like to be cared for in my home or in a place with some of my friends, where there are animals and gardens, good books read aloud, spiritual talks, music and films better than ""The Parent Trap."" But I don't know of such a place. If I learned that I carry the risk factor for Alzheimer's, I might be propelled to find or create such a situation while I'm still able.  CON:  1. The body is mysterious. Spontaneous healing can occur, and disease can strike people in peak health. In Alzheimer's disease, it's believed that several genes combine with environmental factors to bring on the disease, so why focus on one gene that may or may not be the trigger?   2. We're dealing not with the present but the future. Who knows what medical advances will occur in the next 20 years? Who knows if there'll even be life on the planet?  I could go back and forth, but the salient question is, would I conduct my life differently if I knew I was at risk? Probably not. Still, it would be a terrific comfort to find out I do not have the gene. But is that comfort worth gambling on the far more likely result — learning that I do carry it?  I had an uncle, Art, who in his 80s used to write his address on the back of his hand, explaining with a laugh that if he forgot his address, he'd be able to get home. At the time I thought he was joking, but now I know he was not.   And he never developed Alzheimer's.   Sara Davidson is the author of ""Leap: What Will We Do With the Rest of Our Lives?""      ",[]

100,dementia,2009,The New York Times,Health Benefit? How About Pleasure?,Health Benefit? How About Pleasure?,"Wine's supposed health benefits might not be all they're cracked up to be, but who cares?.","Science Times has a fascinating article that questions the conventional wisdom that moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages is good for the health. Nobody in the article disputes the possibility that moderate drinking can be beneficial. Those interviewed simply make the compelling argument that too many variables exist in the research to conclude that moderate wine consumption is the reason for any healthful findings. Obviously, the wine industry is hugely vested in the idea that a daily glass or two is good for the health. Wine Spectator  regularly highlights studies that depict wine as a healthy beverage (its Web site currently includes an article suggesting that a glass or two of wine a day may prevent gallstones). Indeed, the tremendous growth in American red wine consumption in the 1990s was largely due to reports of the French paradox, the idea that the French, with a diet relatively high in fat have a lower incidence of heart disease than Americans. The paradox held that consumption of red wine may be what reduces heart disease in France. Personally speaking, whether wine is good for me or not has nothing to do with why I drink it. I drink wine because I love it. I do not believe that moderate consumption is bad for me. I think drinking wine is in fact good for me because it gives me pleasure and makes me happy, and I believe that people who are happy tend to be healthier than people who are unhappy. But does it have a direct effect on aspects of health? Who can say? I have worked at The New York Times for 25 years (come September) and I can't tell you how many health studies I have read in that time that haven't come close to being conclusive. Remember the oat bran fad? Twenty years ago some study indicated oat bran might help lower cholesterol. Instant mania. Instant marketing. Instant profits. Until people realized that oat bran was not nearly all it was baked up to be. It's always the same way. Fads and fears come and go, and the real wisdom is always the same: Eat, drink and live how you like, but do so in moderation. Exercise, don't smoke, and you know the rest. Enjoy wine because it gives pleasure, not because it's a panacea for heart disease, gallstones, dementia or anything else.",[]
117,dementia,2009,The New York Times,Is a Mediterranean Diet Good for the Brain?,Mediterranean Diet May Prevent Mental Decline,A Mediterranean-style diet appears to be good for the brain as well as the heart.,"Eating a Mediterranean diet appears to lower risk for mental decline, and may help prevent Alzheimer's in people with existing memory problems, new research suggests.  The finding, published today in The Archives of Neurology, tracked the eating habits of 1,393 people with no cognitive problems and 482 patients with mild cognitive impairment, a preliminary state of mental decline that can sometimes signal the onset of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. The patients were then grouped based on whether they were low, moderate or consistent followers of a Mediterranean diet. People were considered to be strong adherents to a Mediterranean-style diet if they regularly ate large amounts of fish, fruits, vegetables, legumes and monounsaturated fats like olive oil, while at the same time consuming moderate amounts of alcohol and only small quantities of meat and dairy products.  After nearly five years of follow up, about 275 people in the healthy group developed mild cognitive impairment. People who closely adhered to a Mediterranean diet had a 28 percent lower risk of developing mild cognitive impairment, compared to those whose eating habits were the least like a Mediterranean diet. Moderate followers of a Mediterranean diet showed a trend toward a 17 percent lower risk than the lowest-scoring group, although that finding wasn't statistically significant.  A Mediterranean diet also appeared to slow decline in those already diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. Among the 482 men and women with mild cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study, 106 developed Alzheimer's disease about four years later. But among those who strictly adhered to the Mediterranean diet, risk of Alzheimer's was 48 percent lower, while risk was 45 percent lower among those who ate a moderate version of the diet.  It's not clear from the study how long the participants had been following a Mediterranean eating plan. However, the researchers said that older people tend to be fairly set in their ways and stick to eating patterns that have been established years earlier, so it's likely the habits were established at least in middle age. The average age of study participants was 77.  Because the study was observational and not a controlled clinical trial, the association of better brain aging with the consumption of a Mediterranean diet isn't definitive and could be explained by other factors. However, researchers note that a Mediterranean diet has already been shown to be good for the heart, and there is no risk in improving eating habits in the hope of improving brain health as well.  ""We know it's a healthy diet for other reasons,'' said lead author Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, assistant professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Center.

138,dementia,2009,The New York Times,Why House Calls Save Money,Why House Calls Save Money,A doctor with the incoming administration's ear is urging a return to in-home care for the elderly.,"Dr. Jack Resnick, an internist in New York, believes that if the frail elderly are treated at home by doctors making house calls, as they did in the good old days, then medical outcomes will improve and Medicare costs can be reduced. Dr. Resnick hosted one of the community health care forums arranged by the Obama transition team on Dec. 29 at the Good Shepherd Community Center on Roosevelt Island in New York City. The following week, Dr. Resnick brought his message to the state capitol in Albany, where he met with health officials responsible for long-term care policy.  Dr. Resnick's own anecdotal experience with house calls has been documented in various medical journals, which report that keeping geriatric patients out of the hospital reduces costs between 30 and 60 percent. With Medicare cost-containment high on the agenda of the incoming administration, I asked Dr. Resnick to share his thoughts. For a different perspective on house calls, you can hear first-hand from his patients at therooseveltdoctor.com. — Jane Gross   Eleven years ago, I started a general internal medicine practice on Roosevelt Island, a small community in the East River connected to Manhattan by subway and an aerial cable car. The island, a planned community started in 1975, had set aside apartments for the homebound, disabled and frail elderly. Soon after I opened my practice, I started getting requests for house calls from people who had been medically isolated — some for decades. I now spend almost a third of my time on house calls to 50 of these people. Most are homebound, quite a few are on respirators, all have multiple chronic illnesses.   My patients have taught me a lot — about how to treat them in particular and about the American health care system in general.  We all recognize that the American health care system is broken and needs to be fixed. Most of the discussion of health care reform focuses on its financing: the uninsured, the underinsured and the difficulty that even the insured face in negotiating its complexities. But even if every American were insured, the system would continue to deliver inadequate care at exorbitant cost. While solving the problem of the uninsured is necessary, it is far from sufficient.  Here are the two changes needed to address the system's failures.   First, everyone must have a single doctor in charge of his care. This doctor should know the person intimately, have immediate access to all of his medical information and must be available around the clock.   Second, much of health care that is now delivered in institutions — hospitals and nursing home — should be provided at home.   I've come to these conclusions over the last decade treating my severely ill patients on Roosevelt Island. Early on, I would try to hospitalize my patients when they developed a severe illness. They would resist mightily, and I soon understood why. They all had had experiences as in-patients and knew well the perils of the hospital. I quickly discovered that a hospital stay for these people almost always left them worse off than before they had been admitted.   The price of getting some intravenous antibiotics for pneumonia, for example, often included bedsores, antibiotic-resistant hospital-acquired infections, medication errors, delirium and dementia.  It's not unusual for one of my patients to wind up in a hospital without my knowledge after a call to 911. In those instances, they almost always wind up in a nursing home after the treatment of their acute illness. Soon, their hospital-acquired confusion and delirium — generally a temporary state — turns into ""dementia"" because the nursing home doctors label them that way. Several times I have had the good fortune of finding one of these ""demented"" people in a nursing home and seen them return to normalcy within a few weeks of returning to the familiar environment of their home.   I've worked very hard to move more of health care into the home. I encounter many barriers.   · Intravenous medication — While it is not difficult to arrange intravenous medication at home for people who need expensive chemotherapy drugs, providing life-sustaining intravenous saline and sugar water on an urgent basis is extremely difficult because the companies that provide both are not set up for on-the-spot delivery. The providers of home-based intravenous treatments make their money on the payments they receive for the substances they infuse. Expensive cancer drugs are much more lucrative than simple antibiotics and salt water.   · Caregivers — The home health aides and attendants are crucial to the survival of my patients. Many times I've seen my charges deteriorate rapidly when a reliable aide leaves their service. One of my patients had been cared for by the same aide for eight years. When the aide had to take a medical leave for a gynecologic procedure, the patient deteriorated rapidly and developed life-threatening urinary tract infections. Even more dramatic was his return to health when, after a three-month absence, his aide returned. Within two weeks, an almost fatal illness had turned around and he was back to his usual self. These caregivers are woefully underpaid and underutilized. They need improved pay scales, broader training, increased responsibilities and a career ladder that will attract and keep them in this vital profession.   · Exercise and physical therapy — Among the most destructive limitations on care at home for the chronically ill are the rules surrounding physical therapy. Patients can only get physical therapy after they have suffered some loss of function. Their exercise program ends when they have gained back as much function as possible. No maintenance therapy is allowed by Medicare. Inevitably, without exercise they lose function again, and a new round of rehabilitation starts. Unfortunately, each of these cycles usually ends with the patient at a lower level of functioning than at the beginning of treatment. It's truly penny-wise and pound-foolish to not provide a constant exercise program.   · Electronic medical records — Several years ago I invested in an electronic medical record for my practice. Now, wherever I am — in a patient's home, on rounds in the hospital, or visiting my grandchildren in Boston — all of their information is in front of me. This is one barrier I've successfully removed. I recommend E.M.R.'s highly to all.   · Early advance planning — I've started putting a lot of energy into getting my patients to talk to their family, friends and caregivers about how they want to be treated. Too often a well-meaning but frightened person calls 911, and one of my patients winds up worse off as they encounter the mishaps of institutional care. Getting all of these concerned people to have early discussions with my patients about how they want to be treated has begun to pay off in longer lives, less illness and more happiness.   · Real-time audio-video access — I've begun to investigate how the Internet can improve care at home. Live Webcam access would allow me to better assess a patient's urgent problem and provide reassurance at a time of great stress. It would allow close monitoring of someone getting acute treatment in the home. And it would make it easier to have a consultant evaluate one of my homebound patients without requiring arduous transportation via ambulance or ambulette.   How do we pay for all of this? Studies have shown that good home-based care dramatically reduces the amount of time people spend in hospitals. A small fraction of the savings generated would cover all of the costs these changes would require.   An even larger question is how do we find physicians who want to commit themselves to such a career, with its huge demands on their time, energies and emotions. The answer is simple. Let them share in those savings so that they earn as much as their colleagues in other specialties.  ",[]

146,dementia,2009,The New York Times,Erasing Your Memories,Erasing Your Memories,Dr. Todd C. Sacktor answers readers' questions about research into the selective erasure of memory.,"What would your life be like if you could erase certain memories? Maybe you could ""forget"" about some traumatic event, a deep-seated fear or a relationship gone wrong.   It seems like science fiction, but researchers may be on the verge of making memory erasure a reality.  (Photo: Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times Dr. Todd C. Sacktor)   Dr. Todd C. Sacktor and his team of scientists from SUNY Downstate Medical Center have been able to show how a single dose of an experimental drug can block the ability of an animal's brain to hold onto specific types of memories.   To read more about Dr. Sacktor's work, read Benedict Carey's article, ""Brain Researchers Open Door to Editing Memory.""   Dr. Sacktor's research raises some interesting questions. How will erasing specific memories affect humans? Will this work lead to a treatment to allow us to retain memory longer?   This week, Dr. Sacktor will answer your questions about memory erasure. Please post your questions and comments below, and check back daily for his responses.    In Response to the Ethical Questions  This strikes me as one of those things that could be extremely dangerous if used improperly. Even ignoring the potential illegal uses, allowing people to erase negative memories is a bad idea.   I'm in general disinclined to promote any kind of ignorance - even if that ignorance would make a person happier. We learn from the past, right? Well, we're supposed to. And sometimes it is learning from painful memories that we become better people.  The only time I can imagine this being okay is in cases of serious, horrendous trauma - rape victims who now cannot live normal lives, child abuse victims, etc. Only in situations where a person has been completely destroyed from an experience, where there is nothing positive to learn. But even then, we are denying reality, denying life. And for better or worse, our memories define who we are.  - James W., Washington D.C.    Dr. Sacktor: The purpose of our experiment with ZIP was to try to understand the molecular basis of memory storage, which previously was a complete scientific mystery. The experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that memories are stored by the action of a specific molecule- PKMzeta. You should know that the notion that a specific molecule stores memory goes completely against the grain of how most neuroscientists have thought about long-term memory for decades. Most neuroscientists thought that memories were stored by anatomical changes in the brain, such as new synapses, not by specific molecules. That is why our results showing a very rapid disruption of long-term memories, first published in Science in 2006, were so striking. The results have been confirmed in many labs around the world, with different drugs that inhibit PKMzeta, and for many different forms of long-term memory. Interestingly, ZIP does not affect short-term memory, or once the drug is gone, the formation of new long-term memories in the same brain region.  Elucidating the molecular mechanism of long-term memory may one day be key, I hope, to developing treatments of memory disorders. But don't forget how long this development from basic science discovery to clinical usefulness takes- decades for even the most important findings, such as germ theory and the structure of DNA.  One important recent publication by my colleagues at SUNY Downstate, Drs. Sue Mirra, John Crary, and Charles Shao, is that PKMzeta is bound up in the neurofibrillary tangles that are found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's Disease. This is likely to alter the function of PKMzeta and may contribute to the memory loss characteristic of that disorder.  But I think that the concerns, even the deep unease, that many of the questions voice reflect two striking features of the experiments with ZIP that go to the essence of PKMzeta's role in memory- features that are also rather surprising to most neuroscientists. These are, first, the rapidity with which long-term memories, three month-old in the rats and presumably decades-old in humans, might be erased. This happens almost immediately with the injection of the drug. Second, is the specificity. As I mentioned, short-term memory, the underlying structure of the brain, and the capacity to form new long-term memories are unaffected.  These two surprising features are because PKMzeta is an enzyme. If you recall from high-school biology, there are two general forms of proteins, structural and enzymatic. Most neuroscientists had assumed that hundreds of structural proteins would be involved in the new synapses thought to store long-term memory. And there would be nothing unique to the structural proteins in the memory-storing synapses, as opposed to those synapses formed in development prior to experience.  But enzymes catalyze very specific chemical reactions and can be rapidly inhibited. That long-term memories are maintained by the constant action of one such enzyme, and thus that memories can be specifically and rapidly erased, was quite a shock.   The Drug's Uses  What are the primary uses you envision for this drug?  - Rebecka L., New Jersey   Dr. Sacktor: There are a few rare or severe cases of psychiatric or neurological disease in which ZIP might be helpful. I am a neurologist, not a psychiatrist, but I understand that there are clinical situations in which, as a last resort, a procedure known as bilateral cingulotomy can be performed. In this procedure, a small region of the brain is destroyed. I could see that, prior to the destruction of the neural tissue, ZIP might be injected to try to ""reset"" the synapses in that region. The drug diffuses around 1-2 mm from an injection site in the brain, so the region affected would be restricted.  For more general application, we have to develop an activity-dependent form of ZIP, i.e., a drug that becomes active only when the neurons are firing intensely, as when a memory is recalled. This might allow a specific, recalled long-term memory to be erased, rather than all long-term memories. I should add that there is a entire subfield of memory research studying the role of what is called ""reconsolidation blockade"" that aims at essentially the same thing. This work is very exciting and has been lead by my colleagues Karim Nader, Joseph LeDoux, Susan Sara, Cristina Alberini, Yadin Dudai, and others. You may have heard about the studies with propranolol on trying to reduce the emotional component of post-traumatic stress memories. How this reconsolidation work fits in with PKMzeta is actively being explored.  Developing memory enhancers that convert short- into long-term memories by increasing PKMzeta in the brain is also a possibility. This has even been done experimentally in the fruit fly by my colleagues, Jerry Yin and Eric Drier, when at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, and now at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.   Is Memory Loss Permanent?  Has the research been ongoing long enough to answer the question of permanency? Is the memory erased forever? And, further, how does the nature of the drug and its effect (physically and chemically) on the brain lead to greater understanding of how memory works. Will dementia figure in the coming research? - William H. Porter   Dr. Sacktor: Three month-old memories in the rat have been erased. Although I don't really buy the analogy, this is equivalent to a 10 year-old memory for a human (rats live around 2 years). I do not see any compelling reason why a three month-old memory would have a biologically different basis than a decades-old memory, but you never know.  We, as well as other researchers, have done extensive experiments to try to see if, once disrupted by ZIP, a memory ever comes back. We waited weeks, we gave reminders, but the memory never seemed to return. Remarkably, giving the drug right before or even during the training had no effect on long-term memory formation tested a few days later. The drug has a pure ""retrograde"" effect. That's why it's so different from clinical cases of amnesia due to brain injuries or dementias like Alzheimer's, which affect both formation of new memories and recall of old. Our experimental result also suggests that the PKMzeta is not made immediately during learning, but after a few hours, and that the drug itself only lasts a few hours.

(Courtesy Intel Corp.))    My colleague John Leland, writing from the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, sent us these musings on the first-ever exhibit there devoted to technology aimed at the elderly, their adult children and their medical providers. He would like to pursue this subject in the future, so if you've had some experience, good or bad, with technological innovations intended for seniors, please post below. We welcome the thoughts of all concerned digerati, parents and children, old and not-so-old. — Jane Gross  At the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, I stepped onto an ordinary-looking white bathroom scale. The scale sent a signal via Bluetooth to a control box, which read my weight aloud.   It was my first time on the scale. We had no relationship. I was just data. The machine was just a disembodied voice.  Then Mikael Hvid, application manager at Tunstall Healthcare A/S, which makes the box, stepped onto the scale. After telling Mr. Hvid his weight, the voice compared the figure with previous readings.   Then it got inquisitive.   ""Are you more tired than usual?"" it asked.   Mr. Hvid was. (This was Las Vegas, after all.) He pressed a ""yes"" button.   ""Are you having trouble sleeping at night?"" Ditto.  Mr. Hvid's weight and answers were all harvested by the box's software, which stood ready to make them available electronically to whomever he gave access: his primary care doctor, family members, perhaps a pulmonologist, maybe the administrators at his assisted living community.   The control box also works with gadgets measuring blood pressure, oxygen level, activity level and other markers of health. If the person on the scale were my mother, I might instruct the box to alert me if her weight rose or fell by a certain amount, or if her answers to questions suggested trouble. Other devices in the exhibition hall tracked whether a user fell, opened a pill bottle, made coffee, used the bathroom excessively at night or wandered out of the home.   In a nutshell, this was the big idea about aging at this year's C.E.S.: how to use mostly simple technologies to gather information and detect warning signs, thereby allowing older people to remain in their own homes with fewer trips to the doctor's office and less need for supervision in a skilled nursing facility.    I imagined my mother's doctors all having a single report that showed how a change in her medication coincided with changes in weight, blood pressure, mood, sleep pattern and gait, then being able to discuss that information with one another, family members and my mother. That would be a big step forward for her and for many like her.  But then I imagined my mother living with a half-dozen electronic boxes beeping for attention and me getting alerts every time one of the measurements was skewed — me, without the medical expertise to sort the blips from the real problems. I'd call her doctor and become ensnared in a voicemail loop that asked if I was more tired than usual and if I was having trouble sleeping at night.   Yes, and heck yes. With technology like this, I might never sleep again.  These devices were unveiled at a day-long program called the Silvers Summit, the first forum at the C.E.S. dedicated to aging. Participants included hospitals, nonprofit groups, retailers, insurers and dozens of entrepreneurs, many of whom got involved after personally experiencing what it is like to care for an elderly relative in decline. Presenters said the technology is aimed not at old people but at their children.  ""The fact that we're in C.E.S. and we're not just one booth means we're getting somewhere,"" said Eric Dishman, the global director of product research and innovation at the Intel Digital Health Group. ""Seven or eight years ago, no one even talked about aging. Something tipped.""   Topics ranged from mental exercise programs for fending off dementia to phones for people with diminished hearing and dexterity. Most of the devices shown were not covered by insurance, and either in prototype or not widely used.   ""Our society does not reimburse for prevention,"" said David Stern, chief professional officer for Living Independently, which produces a home monitoring system called QuietCare that is used in assisted living communities. ""But there's a recognition now that people need technology and that if you can keep someone living at home, it costs a lot less than having them in a nursing home.""   Mr. Stern could not say how much QuietCare cost because each facility programs different features into it. Another system on display, GrandCare, costs $2,300 for the basic equipment, then $25 to $50 a month for the company to manage the flow of data. With GrandCare, relatives can upload photographs, appointments or messages to a device in an elder's home that looks like a television with a touchscreen.   Mr. Stern said the home monitoring technology answered competing needs: ""An older person in assisted living wants to maximize independence. But the expectations of family members and state regulators are that she is going to be made secure 24/7. How do you do both? Technology is the answer. It's the only way they can be secure and independent without someone coming in and checking up on them.""   All vendors said their products were not meant to replace human contact with doctors or family members. But technology has unintended consequences. For some older people, the experience of having blood pressure checked can be the only human touch of the day. An automated home device can take the blood pressure and save the health care system hundreds of dollars, but it does not replace a living, breathing visitor or conversation with fellow patients during otherwise annoying doctor visits.   At one of the forum presentations, Dr. Hyung Tai Kim, a vice president of research at Ascension Health, a Catholic hospital system, identified two potential stumbling blocks for the devices. They called for doctors trained to treat patients in person to make judgments based on data gathered remotely. And current insurance programs do not compensate the doctors for these analyses.   Some of these gadgets will prove useful. Many others will become the home treadmills of the future — developed and purchased in good faith, but in practice unused. Mr. Dishman of Intel described a pillbox that alerted users every day at the same time that they needed to take a pill, even if they had already taken it. As a result, people didn't use it, he said.  ""No one wants to be nagged or be embarrassed by something that makes them look like they can't take care of themselves,"" he said. ""We switched to one that was more responsive to whether you already took the pill, and we quadrupled compliance.""  ""Those little tweaks go a long way,"" he added.  The prototypes are now out there. Let the grumbling and tweaking begin. ",[]
243,dementia,2009,The New York Times,The Kindness of Strangers,Wise Counsel at Unexpected Moments,"Advice received at unexpected moments, often from strangers, has turned out to be the most effective counsel of all.","As I was moving my widowed mother from a retirement community in Alabama to a nursing home near me in New Jersey, there was a particularly awkward moment on our flight when, somewhere over Philadelphia, she had to use the bathroom.   My mother, then 78, had dementia and balance problems and couldn't walk without help. Arm in arm, we inched up the aisle, lurching with the turbulence. Somehow, I steered her into the tiny stall and onto the toilet seat, then squeezed myself inside so as to close the door and give her some privacy. Suffice it to say that it's a lot easier to change a baby's diaper than a mother's Depends in an airplane bathroom.  (Photo: The author and her mother, Irene Russakoff, in a snapshot taken in 1998, the year she arrived at a New Jersey nursing home.)   A flight attendant caught my eye as we returned to our seats and gave me a knowing, sympathetic smile. On the ground in Newark, as I settled my mother into a wheelchair for the ride down the jetway into an uncharted stage of her life (and mine), that flight attendant touched my shoulder and said one sentence that I remember to this day: ""Just don't hurry.""  Her advice caught me off guard because it was so different from the conversations I'd had with myself about this new responsibility. I had a demanding job, a husband, two young children, a dog and a house, and now I had a mother to take care of, too. In order to keep up, I had to do everything faster, right? Wrong, this woman was saying.   I heard her voice in my head many times in my mother's last six years as she became sicker and needed me more and more. ""Just don't hurry"" became a way of willing myself to be calm when I was with her, no matter how distressing the challenges. As years passed, everything took her more time — dressing, eating, talking, getting in and out of wheelchairs and, yes, going to the bathroom. ""Just don't hurry"" helped me experience life at my mother's pace and understand a little better what she was facing.  Anyone who cares for an aging parent gets no shortage of unsolicited advice. But every now and then, one comment resonates — and helps, again and again. This was the first of several that I came to value.   Another came from a nurse at the nursing home where my mother spent those final six years. My mother had deep bouts of depression, which medication wasn't helping, and at various points I was visiting almost nightly just to keep her company. I was losing sleep, and I'm sure I looked as stressed out as I felt.  One night, a nurse named Ann, who had that nurse's knack for being crisp and caring at the same time, looked sternly at me and said, ""You know, your mother could live another 20 years. And if she does, you won't."" She said it with such authority that she scared me. And I realized suddenly that Ann was right: no way could I do this for 20 years. (As I said, my mother lived only six.)  I didn't stop responding to my mother, but I came less often — usually one weeknight and weekends. She ultimately accepted that, restoring my life expectancy.  Still, I was often the first target for her frustration, and one night my mother lashed out at me in front of her brother and his wife, who were visiting from New Mexico. I don't remember what triggered this, but I do recall my Aunt Sherry saying softly from behind me, ""Be a duck.""   Baffled, I turned around to see her very discreetly miming a duck letting water roll off its back. This was so comical, and so supportive, that it short-circuited the hurt and anger welling up inside me. ""Be a duck"" became a handy mental trick to stop myself from sweating the small stuff.  My younger son, then 7, delivered some helpful advice unintentionally one night when he asked, ""Mommy, when you get old, are you going to be like Nana?"" I remember saying something to try to ease his fears, but I also remember realizing all at once that my role as caregiver wasn't just for my mother's benefit. For better or worse, my children were watching carefully and would draw big, possibly lifelong lessons from what they witnessed. Caregiving felt less lonely when I thought of it as trying to be a good mother instead of just a good daughter.  In the last year of her life, my mother lost the ability to speak. On visits, I tried to fill the silences with whatever I thought would interest her, but the one-way conversation seemed only to accentuate her isolation, rather than relieving it. I mentioned this to a colleague, who suggested I call his wife, Suzanne Southworth, then a clinical psychologist consulting with nursing homes in the Washington area. ""People communicate all the time without words,"" Suzanne said.  Instantly, I thought of plenty of nonverbal ways we could communicate. My mother had been an avid gardener when I was a child, so I bought her an amaryllis, and each time I visited, we would look at it together and marvel at how it seemed to grow literally before our eyes. She also was an art enthusiast, and we paged through her many art books, admiring Impressionists, Expressionists, Cubists and more. My father had been a jazz trumpet player in his spare time, and we listened to tapes of him and his combo playing ""It Might as Well Be Spring,"" ""Summertime"" and dozens of big band standards. We also looked at her many photo albums.  The last time I saw my mother alive, we happened to look at her pictures of my 7-year-old birthday party. I was holding a brand new Beatles album above my head, and all my friends and I were squealing some form of Beatlemania. ""Oh my God, Mom, do you remember that?!"" I exclaimed. She gave a huge nod, her eyes glistened and we both threw back our heads and laughed out loud.  One sentence of advice from Suzanne gave us back our common ground, our mother-daughter mutuality. What wise words have made a difference for you? ",[]
247,dementia,2009,The New York Times,Learning to Be Good Enough,Learning to Be Good Enough,Many caregivers learn the hard way that there are no perfect solutions.,"Not long ago, following a reader's suggestion, I found the Web site SilverPlanet, one of a growing number of online destinations for leading-edge Baby Boomers that offers information, blogs and resources on subjects such as health, finances and entertainment.   The site is a bit busy for my taste, trying to be all things to all people, but I was immediately drawn to the title of one blog: ""A Good Enough Daughter'' by Sara Myers, who has 30 years of professional experience in the field of aging at the National Adult Day Services Association and the Washington Adult Day Services Association — and about a year of personal experience as a family caregiver for her 90-year-old mother.   There is an old saying about not letting the perfect drive out the good, a notion that I think is essential to providing sensible and loving care to an aging parent and maintaining one's sanity during the process. I tell friends and colleagues who enter this parallel universe to realize that there are many different trajectories to this experience but only one endpoint.   Your mother or father, regardless of what you do or don't do, will die.   Blunt? You betcha. Unwelcome information? To many of you, I suspect so. But also liberating — permission to not let the perfect drive out the good.   As the adult child with an ailing parent, you are faced with many choices, and more often than not, you don't have a clue which is the right one. Slowly — very, very slowly — I have come to see there is rarely a ""right"" or ""wrong"" decision when the goal is not to prolong life but rather to enhance its quality. At least, there is certainly not a ""right"" or ""wrong"" medical decision.   During the years spent caring for my own mother, that realization meant I could focus my energy on being kind, consoling and attentive. I could bear witness and stop trying to fix things, could commiserate more and worry less. That would be good enough, maybe better than good enough. It would not be perfect, and that was O.K.   I contacted Ms. Myers and asked her how she had chosen the title to her blog. Below is her reply, a version of which she used to introduce herself last June. And be sure to read two of her posts, ""Aunt Babe Died: What Do I Tell My Mother?"" and ""The Sacred Cloth."" I enjoyed them and hope you will, too. ¬— Jane Gross    By Sara Myers  I am 57 years old and have two sons, ages 20 and 16, and have a fine job that I have held for almost 15 years. When my 90-year-old mother took a series of falls about a year ago while living in Phoenix, it was my job as the only daughter and ""professional in aging"" to fly to Phoenix (from my home on Bainbridge Island, Washington) and do whatever was necessary to make everything right.   My mother lived in Phoenix for over 60 years. When I arrived at her home, she made clear that she wasn't about to move or accept help. Realizing that I could not wrap her up in bubble wrap and ship her to my hometown, I took a deep breath and decided to do what I could. I visited with doctors and talked to friends and neighbors. I brought in the home care workers (against protest), ""equity loaned"" the house, and fixed and fixed and fixed. I did whatever I could do to make the situation safe, while complying with my mother's adamantly held decision to never leave her home.   Four falls, four hospitalizations, six months and 30,000 frequent flyers miles later, I made the decision: mom had to move near me. The latest fall took my mother into a nearby rehabilitation center. It was crummy at best. I guess the rehabilitation services were probably up to par, but the facility was late-60's architecture and while the staff was pleasant enough, they always seemed busy doing something other than actually taking care of a resident. I walked into my mother's room, and she said to me, ""Get me out of here. I'm ready to move to Bainbridge.""   I quickly put my geriatric case manager hat on and began to plan the move. I had plenty of work to do. I had to pack up as many of my mother's things as I could and ship them to Bainbridge and find a rehabilitation center near my home that had an opening. It was a whirlwind experience. Thank God for my friends Jo and Kathy, who helped me work out all of the details.   I thought it would be less stressful to have Mom near me. I did not exactly work out that way. I made daily visits, conducted chart reviews, talked with staff, and reported to my brothers and to my mother's 100 friends, all while working and trying to pay some attention to my family. I quickly became slightly insane.  Whatever it was I was doing revealed to My Dear Husband that I was going over the edge. My mood was unpredictable. I became demanding and emotionally needy. My Dear Husband sat me down and suggested that my recent weight gain was related to caregiving stress and that I should consider something, anything. I listened to him and realized that something had to give — and it was not going to be my health or sanity. I had to give up the idea that I could make it all right, that I could make my mother feel good about leaving Phoenix, that I could magically make her walk independently again. I decided that all I could do was be a good enough daughter — not perfect, but good enough.   My mother is on her way to her 91st birthday. Dementia is definitely part of the picture, but other than that, she's in pretty good shape. She may live for years. In the past year, I have learned that there is no such thing as a perfect caregiver or perfect daughter or perfect son. Just when we think we have a plan, just when we think we have it all figured out, everything changes: a fall, a no-show paid caregiver, an irate sister or brother, a placement option that doesn't work, or a medication that turns everything upside down. I think we should try to do the best we can, when we can. We should strive for good, sufficient, satisfactory, helpful, and healthy, or okay — never perfect. Perfect does not exit in the world of family caregiving.  ",[]

276,dementia,2009,The New York Times,A Long-Term Care Model,Health Care Delivered as It Should Be,One model for long-term care is earning much-deserved praise.,"Hardly anyone has a good word to say about this country's fragmented system for delivering and paying for long-term care, with one exception: the PACE program, which many experts laud as long-term care done right.  PACE, an acronym for ""program of all-inclusive care for the elderly,"" provides anything and everything a frail elderly person and her family might need, coordinated by a team of medical and social service providers, for an annual fee generally paid by Medicare and Medicaid. The care can be delivered at home, a PACE center, a hospital or a long-term care facility -- seamlessly moving back and forth under the supervision of one interdisciplinary team for a fixed cost.   The model for PACE was developed 27 years ago in San Francisco's Chinatown/North Beach area by a community center called On Lok (Cantonese for ""peaceful, happy abode""). The On Lok approach was replicated elsewhere using foundation grants and gradually embraced by Congress, which eventually authorized all PACE programs as Medicare providers.  The formula is hard to quarrel with. According to several studies, PACE clients, while far more frail than the average Medicare recipient, cost taxpayers less money in government-funded medical care, have fewer and shorter hospital stays, rarely wind up in nursing homes (even though they must be eligible to enroll in one), and report satisfaction rates close to 100 percent.   Readers of this blog, physicians, researchers in geriatrics and gerontology, clients and family members -- all have urged that I visit a PACE center, and so recently I did.  The nation's largest PACE provider is the Comprehensive Care Management Corporation in the Bronx. What I found there is a model that bridges the customary divide between acute and chronic care, and assigns each client to an interdisciplinary team that coordinates care across different settings. The program pays for coverage as a H.M.O. would, with a fixed annual cost per patient rather than a fee-for-service set-up.    But unlike many H.M.O.'s, the program doesn't operate as a faceless bureaucracy serving as gatekeeper to all but primary care physicians, and granting and denying services or procedures. Rather, at 40-odd locations in 22 states, PACE means care by an interdisciplinary team that knows the patient and family, their histories, strengths, limitations and goals. Team members decide the care plan with each member, tweak it as things change, and rarely say 'no' to anything that will sustain quality of life.   PACE offers its members access to primary care physicians, specialists, home health aides, transportation, recreation and companionship at a day center, meals (at the center or delivered to home), medical assistance on call 24-hours-a-day -- and just about anything else that will make it possible for extremely frail and cognitively impaired elders to remain at home.   The breadth and flexibility of PACE's services were apparent during a daily team meeting in late December, on the eve of a snow storm. First the assembled doctors, nurses, social workers, rehabilitation and recreation specialists, transportation coordinators, clinic schedulers and office managers reviewed the overnight emergency calls. These had been answered by a real person who had assessed whether a trip to the emergency room was needed or the problem could be handled by phone or with a home visit, always the goal. One person hospitalized overnight because of seizures had already received a dawn visit from her regular PACE doctor, with reassurance that her home health aide was on standby for her return and that her missing coat had been located.  The team then discussed new clients and those needing changes in their care plan: a woman who felt well enough to come to the center five days a week and thus required a new transportation schedule; a hospitalized patient ready for discharge whom they hoped to keep to keep longer, since his wife needed a break from caregiving; a new member who'd asked for more fresh fruits and vegetables among the daily lunch choices.   Next came a review of everyone who had been expected that day at the center on Allerton Avenue -- one of seven run by C.C.M. in the New York metropolitan area -- but had not shown up yet. Some were out of town visiting relatives, others at outside medical appointments or under the weather. A few had been stranded by transportation glitches. Anyone unaccounted for -- and there were only a few -- would be called or visited immediately, especially with the storm bearing down.  All PACE members are ranked by priority. Level 1 means they can't be alone at home without an aide. Level 2 means they need someone to shop, organize medications or otherwise make a short home visit every day. And level 3 means they are either safe alone or have family or neighbors for back-up support. Since weather reports suggested the center might have only a skeleton staff the next day, arrangements were made to get aides, food, backup oxygen tanks and whatever was needed to each of 300 clients classified at levels 1 or 2. For level 3 clients, staff would double check that relatives and friends hadn't all decamped for the holidays.   Outside the meeting room, three staff physicians were seeing patients. On certain days, they are joined by a wound care expert, since pressure sores are an abiding problem for those who spend all their time in bed or in a wheelchair. Also available are two psychiatrists specializing in depression, anxiety and dementia-related agitation; an ophthalmologist and optometrist to treat the myriad of vision problems associated with age; and a podiatrist, because many older people cannot cut their own toenails and risk infection or diabetic complications if the job is not done regularly and carefully.   Other specialists, on contract from a local hospital, see patients in their own offices, with transportation and translation provided by PACE, as well as immediate consultation between the primary care doctor and the specialist.  In the recreation and dining areas, members are welcome for breakfast and lunch and sent home with dinner. At the Allerton Ave. center, located in an area with a large Latino population, someone reads newspapers aloud in Spanish every day, down to the horoscopes and the box scores.   Staff members take notice if anyone is making frequent trips to the bathroom, and a nurse is on hand to check for a urinary tract infection, another condition especially dangerous for the elderly. The center has handicapped-accessible showers for those who can't use the ones they have at home, as well as washing machines and dryers. Some clients manage but one visit a week; others come daily. All are provided free transport, with an aide if necessary, but also have the option of many of the same services at home.   All PACE members nationwide must be 55 or older and eligible under state regulations for nursing home placement, which generally means they require assistance or supervision with basic tasks like bathing, dressing, walking or getting from bed to a wheelchair. Medicare, which provides health coverage for all Americans over the age of 65, pays a share of the ""capitated"" annual free per member. Medicaid pays the remainder for those who qualify on grounds of low income.  Anyone otherwise eligible for PACE but not covered by Medicaid can make up the difference out-of-pocket, which in New York State would be around $3,500 a month -- a tidy sum but far less than the cost of home health aides, assisted living with the enhanced services people this frail would need, or placement in a skilled nursing facility. In other words, this excellent care is not limited to the indigent, as it is in many other pilot programs run by Medicaid.   Each PACE program must manage its funds wisely, lest the cost of services exceeds the fixed fees. That encourages preventive care that members might not receive otherwise. For instance, government reimbursement and most private insurance will not pay for ongoing physical therapy once a patient has ""plateaued,"" and so often treatment stops, which can lead to further loss of mobility. But since physical therapy is cheaper than repairing a broken hip or providing round-the-clock care for someone who is bed-bound, PACE does pay for ongoing physical therapy, an approach that is cost-effective to the taxpayer, according to several studies, and leads to better outcomes.   After a day at the PACE center, my only reservation is whether a middle-class person -- say, my mother -- would have given a program like this a chance or been put off by the race, ethnicity or cultural differences of the other clients. She was by no means a prejudiced woman, but the older she got the more her comfort level depended on being among people of similar background.   I was embarrassed to raise this question. But, PACE officials told me, my mother's resistance would not have been unusual or viewed as a sign of bad character. Shared experience matters at this time of life, and PACE centers tend to reflect the neighborhoods where they are located. My mother might have done well at C.C.M.'s Westchester County center, in White Plains, N.Y., or a center in Amityville on Long Island that is soon to open.   PACE centers around the country are listed on the Web site of the National PACE Association, along with program details. Further information is available through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. My thanks to all of you who told me to go take a look. ",[]

Penny started the series in 2005 after two decades as a CBC radio host, and its popularity caught her by surprise. “It’s difficult to learn from success. I’ve learned more from my mistakes,” she told the author and critic Joel Yanofsky in 2013. “Fortunately, I’m capable of manufacturing my own problems.” In her 20s and early 30s those included a battle with alcoholism, and later a five-year bout of writer’s block that was, according to Yanofsky, “mainly spent watching Oprah, eating gummy bears and lying to everyone, including her husband, about how well her writing was going.” Things have improved since then. “Now I know that if I’m not in the top five on the Times best-seller list, I’m going to feel like a failure,” she said in the same interview. No worries here! But that doesn’t mean Penny’s life is challenge-free: In the past few years she’s had to care for her husband as he slides into dementia. “I find now that the writing is a safe harbor,” she told The Vancouver Sun last month. “It’s a place I go to that is mine.” You have to wonder if Penny had her husband’s condition in mind when she quoted Yeats’s “The Second Coming” in the new book — that’s the poem about things falling apart and the center not holding, which concludes, “And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, / Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?” Maybe.

Triumphant, she arrived home to a Happy Birthday sign in the front yard, a treat of beignets from a Creole restaurant and the news that her 17-year-old brother did not have pinkeye, as their mother initially suspected, but Covid-19. They all did, it turned out: Sarah, who asked to be identified by her middle name to protect her privacy; her brother; their 85-year-old grandfather; and their mother, a nurse practitioner who started having trouble breathing two days after her son tested positive. Sarah had thought she would first take advantage of her license to drive herself to cheerleading practice; instead, she used it to take her mother to get a coronavirus test, when her mother realized she was already too weak to drive herself. Then, a week later, Sarah’s mother — who had not been leaving the couch and was having trouble finishing her sentences — told her she needed to be driven to the hospital. Her pastor and other members of her church would be checking in, but Sarah would have to look after everyone. That meant taking care of her grandfather, who had Parkinson’s disease and some dementia, and her brother, who had autism. Could she do that? Sarah, whose eyes had grown wide, quickly recovered. Yes, she told her mother. Of course she could.","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Teenagers and Adolescence', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Depression (Mental)', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'E-Learning', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Education (Secondary)', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Quarantine (Life and Culture)', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}]"
