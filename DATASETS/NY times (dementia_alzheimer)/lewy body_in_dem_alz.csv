But there's another way to tell this familiar tale: an elderly man with no known medical problems has a sudden change in mental status characterized by confusion and vivid hallucinations involving friends and relatives, which leaves him in a state of trembling mania and uncharacteristic euphoria. This also describes Ebenezer Scrooge -- but as a doctor might see him. What caused these extraordinary symptoms? a doctor might ask. Could some pathological process have accounted for Scrooge's remarkable experience?","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Dickens, Charles', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': ""Alzheimer's Disease"", 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Dementia', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'LEWY BODY DEMENTIA', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Books and Literature', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Medicine and Health', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': ""Parkinson's Disease"", 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'CHRISTMAS CAROL, A (BOOK)', 'rank': 8, 'major': 'N'}]"
