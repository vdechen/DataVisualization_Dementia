A Web site redesign brings up the race card; the changing nature of a poker game.,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/magazine/29FOB-ethicist-t.html,A Web site redesign brings up the race card; the changing nature of a poker game.," I am a consultant on the redesign of the Web site of a company with local franchises across the United States. A franchisee in San Diego mentioned that posting a generic picture of an African-American customer could deter potential business. He has never had an African-American client nor does he anticipate one. His clientele is 70 percent white, 29 percent Hispanic and 1 percent Asian. Each local office will have a Web page and could have its own generic customer photo. May race be a factor in choosing it?

"With a family history of Alzheimer's disease, even minor memory lapses can be terrifying.",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/blogs/17newoldage-knowing-181.html,"With a family history of Alzheimer's disease, even minor memory lapses can be terrifying.","(Photo: Carmel Zucker for The New York TimesThe author at work in her home office in 2007. With a family history of Alzheimer's disease, even occasional lapses in memory cause her to worry.)   This morning I couldn't remember the street number of my house. My own house! Don't panic, I thought, don't struggle to remember it. Just go on with other things, and it'll float to the surface. But it didn't, so I opened the front door and read the street numbers aloud, trying to fix them in my brain.  Lots of people have these lapses, I know. But one week ago, I was sitting with my mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, in a memory care center in Honolulu. We were in the ""living room"" filled with 20 Benjamin Buttons, 20 people aging backward, regressing to infancy. Not in body, as in the movie, but in mind.   One woman who'd been a political journalist sat hugging a teddy bear. ""What is your full name?"" a nurses' assistant asked the group. Half of them shook their heads, baffled. My mother remembers her name but sometimes thinks I'm her older sister. She seems happy, though, as she eats dinner with the group in silence before they're herded to the parlor to watch a DVD of ""The Parent Trap."" She's not suffering, but I am, feeling heartsick every time I drive away.   Not only my mother but both her parents had dementia and were institutionalized. So when I have a lapse like today's, I ask myself, ""Is it starting?""   There's a blood test one can take that shows if you carry a gene that's a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Should I take it? My gut reaction is no, since there's no cure or way to prevent the disease.  Nonetheless, I do research on the genetics of Alzheimer's. According to a report by the Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center, no gene has been identified as the cause of late-onset Alzheimer's, which occurs after 60. (That's not late for this reporter; it's now!) But one genetic risk factor has been confirmed by many studies to increase the likelihood of developing the disease. That risk factor is the gene variant APOE4, found on chromosome 19. If you carry this variant, you're more prone to develop Alzheimer's disease -- 40 percent of people with the disease have APOE4, according to the report.  On the other hand, you may not develop Alzheimer's even if you test positive for APOE4, and if you don't carry the gene, you still may contract the disease.  I make a list of the pro's and con's of testing for APOE4.  PRO:  1. Information is power. Dr. Lenny Guarente, a biology professor at M.I.T. who studies genes that may determine how long we live, says people who test positive for APOE4 often ""handle the information well."" Many prefer to know and adjust to the fact than live with doubts.  2. You can make plans. During my yearly physical, I told my doctor I'm worried about memory loss because dementia runs in my family. He suggested I tell my children how I'd want to be cared for if the need should arise. Ideally, I'd like to be cared for in my home or in a place with some of my friends, where there are animals and gardens, good books read aloud, spiritual talks, music and films better than ""The Parent Trap."" But I don't know of such a place. If I learned that I carry the risk factor for Alzheimer's, I might be propelled to find or create such a situation while I'm still able.  CON:  1. The body is mysterious. Spontaneous healing can occur, and disease can strike people in peak health. In Alzheimer's disease, it's believed that several genes combine with environmental factors to bring on the disease, so why focus on one gene that may or may not be the trigger?   2. We're dealing not with the present but the future. Who knows what medical advances will occur in the next 20 years? Who knows if there'll even be life on the planet?  I could go back and forth, but the salient question is, would I conduct my life differently if I knew I was at risk? Probably not. Still, it would be a terrific comfort to find out I do not have the gene. But is that comfort worth gambling on the far more likely result — learning that I do carry it?  I had an uncle, Art, who in his 80s used to write his address on the back of his hand, explaining with a laugh that if he forgot his address, he'd be able to get home. At the time I thought he was joking, but now I know he was not.   And he never developed Alzheimer's.   Sara Davidson is the author of ""Leap: What Will We Do With the Rest of Our Lives?""

This novel imagines life as faced by a man with Alzheimer’s.,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/books/review/Halpern-t.html,This novel imagines life as faced by a man with Alzheimer’s.,"No disease is more feared by more people than Alzheimer’s. It tops cancer and heart disease on the anxiety scale, even though both are more prevalent. This may be because Alzheimer’s is primarily a disease of old age, and we are an aging nation. With 10 million baby boomers expected to develop Alz­heimer’s in their lifetimes, with one new case every minute or so, the numbers are wickedly inclusive. But it cuts deeper. We all have an inkling of what it might be like to have this disease because we know what it’s like to forget a name or lose a word, and the mind, envisioning its own demise, is quick to parlay those lapses into something bigger: a permanent ellipse where words had been or a string of unremembered faces that eventually come to include the face we see in the mirror.

A Mediterranean-style diet appears to be good for the brain as well as the heart.,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/blogs/10well-mediterr885.html,A Mediterranean-style diet appears to be good for the brain as well as the heart.,"Eating a Mediterranean diet appears to lower risk for mental decline, and may help prevent Alzheimer's in people with existing memory problems, new research suggests.  The finding, published today in The Archives of Neurology, tracked the eating habits of 1,393 people with no cognitive problems and 482 patients with mild cognitive impairment, a preliminary state of mental decline that can sometimes signal the onset of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. The patients were then grouped based on whether they were low, moderate or consistent followers of a Mediterranean diet. People were considered to be strong adherents to a Mediterranean-style diet if they regularly ate large amounts of fish, fruits, vegetables, legumes and monounsaturated fats like olive oil, while at the same time consuming moderate amounts of alcohol and only small quantities of meat and dairy products.  After nearly five years of follow up, about 275 people in the healthy group developed mild cognitive impairment. People who closely adhered to a Mediterranean diet had a 28 percent lower risk of developing mild cognitive impairment, compared to those whose eating habits were the least like a Mediterranean diet. Moderate followers of a Mediterranean diet showed a trend toward a 17 percent lower risk than the lowest-scoring group, although that finding wasn't statistically significant.  A Mediterranean diet also appeared to slow decline in those already diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. Among the 482 men and women with mild cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study, 106 developed Alzheimer's disease about four years later. But among those who strictly adhered to the Mediterranean diet, risk of Alzheimer's was 48 percent lower, while risk was 45 percent lower among those who ate a moderate version of the diet.  It's not clear from the study how long the participants had been following a Mediterranean eating plan. However, the researchers said that older people tend to be fairly set in their ways and stick to eating patterns that have been established years earlier, so it's likely the habits were established at least in middle age. The average age of study participants was 77.  Because the study was observational and not a controlled clinical trial, the association of better brain aging with the consumption of a Mediterranean diet isn't definitive and could be explained by other factors. However, researchers note that a Mediterranean diet has already been shown to be good for the heart, and there is no risk in improving eating habits in the hope of improving brain health as well.  ""We know it's a healthy diet for other reasons,'' said lead author Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, assistant professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Center. ""It makes sense for people to eat in a healthy way as soon as they can and for the longest they possibly can.''

Ellick followed the story of a Pakistani family forced from their home in the Swat Valley. Ziaudin Yousafzai runs a girl's school in Mingora and wants his daughter Malala to pursue her dream of becoming a doctor. But the Taliban have closed the school and forced thousands of people to flee the city. Malala moves from place to place - four cities in two months - living with relatives, while Mr. Yousafzai heads to Peshawar to stage protests in the hope of pressuring the government to rescue the city from the Taliban. They will return to Swat, but everything will be different. It is heart-rending; beautifully told and beautifully shot. Be warned, however, that there are several disturbing scenes. Though long (nearly 20 minutes), the story moves quickly toward its poignant, hopeful conclusion.

Dr. Todd C. Sacktor answers readers' questions about research into the selective erasure of memory.,https://consults.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/blogs/13consults-memory-e117.html,Dr. Todd C. Sacktor answers readers' questions about research into the selective erasure of memory.,"What would your life be like if you could erase certain memories? Maybe you could ""forget"" about some traumatic event, a deep-seated fear or a relationship gone wrong.   It seems like science fiction, but researchers may be on the verge of making memory erasure a reality.  (Photo: Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times Dr. Todd C. Sacktor)   Dr. Todd C. Sacktor and his team of scientists from SUNY Downstate Medical Center have been able to show how a single dose of an experimental drug can block the ability of an animal's brain to hold onto specific types of memories.   To read more about Dr. Sacktor's work, read Benedict Carey's article, ""Brain Researchers Open Door to Editing Memory.""   Dr. Sacktor's research raises some interesting questions. How will erasing specific memories affect humans? Will this work lead to a treatment to allow us to retain memory longer?   This week, Dr. Sacktor will answer your questions about memory erasure. Please post your questions and comments below, and check back daily for his responses.    In Response to the Ethical Questions  This strikes me as one of those things that could be extremely dangerous if used improperly. Even ignoring the potential illegal uses, allowing people to erase negative memories is a bad idea.   I'm in general disinclined to promote any kind of ignorance - even if that ignorance would make a person happier. We learn from the past, right? Well, we're supposed to. And sometimes it is learning from painful memories that we become better people.  The only time I can imagine this being okay is in cases of serious, horrendous trauma - rape victims who now cannot live normal lives, child abuse victims, etc. Only in situations where a person has been completely destroyed from an experience, where there is nothing positive to learn. But even then, we are denying reality, denying life. And for better or worse, our memories define who we are.  - James W., Washington D.C.    Dr. Sacktor: The purpose of our experiment with ZIP was to try to understand the molecular basis of memory storage, which previously was a complete scientific mystery. The experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that memories are stored by the action of a specific molecule- PKMzeta. You should know that the notion that a specific molecule stores memory goes completely against the grain of how most neuroscientists have thought about long-term memory for decades. Most neuroscientists thought that memories were stored by anatomical changes in the brain, such as new synapses, not by specific molecules. That is why our results showing a very rapid disruption of long-term memories, first published in Science in 2006, were so striking. The results have been confirmed in many labs around the world, with different drugs that inhibit PKMzeta, and for many different forms of long-term memory. Interestingly, ZIP does not affect short-term memory, or once the drug is gone, the formation of new long-term memories in the same brain region.  Elucidating the molecular mechanism of long-term memory may one day be key, I hope, to developing treatments of memory disorders. But don't forget how long this development from basic science discovery to clinical usefulness takes- decades for even the most important findings, such as germ theory and the structure of DNA.  One important recent publication by my colleagues at SUNY Downstate, Drs. Sue Mirra, John Crary, and Charles Shao, is that PKMzeta is bound up in the neurofibrillary tangles that are found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's Disease. This is likely to alter the function of PKMzeta and may contribute to the memory loss characteristic of that disorder.  But I think that the concerns, even the deep unease, that many of the questions voice reflect two striking features of the experiments with ZIP that go to the essence of PKMzeta's role in memory- features that are also rather surprising to most neuroscientists. These are, first, the rapidity with which long-term memories, three month-old in the rats and presumably decades-old in humans, might be erased. This happens almost immediately with the injection of the drug. Second, is the specificity. As I mentioned, short-term memory, the underlying structure of the brain, and the capacity to form new long-term memories are unaffected.  These two surprising features are because PKMzeta is an enzyme. If you recall from high-school biology, there are two general forms of proteins, structural and enzymatic. Most neuroscientists had assumed that hundreds of structural proteins would be involved in the new synapses thought to store long-term memory. And there would be nothing unique to the structural proteins in the memory-storing synapses, as opposed to those synapses formed in development prior to experience.  But enzymes catalyze very specific chemical reactions and can be rapidly inhibited. That long-term memories are maintained by the constant action of one such enzyme, and thus that memories can be specifically and rapidly erased, was quite a shock.   The Drug's Uses  What are the primary uses you envision for this drug?  - Rebecka L., New Jersey   Dr. Sacktor: There are a few rare or severe cases of psychiatric or neurological disease in which ZIP might be helpful. I am a neurologist, not a psychiatrist, but I understand that there are clinical situations in which, as a last resort, a procedure known as bilateral cingulotomy can be performed. In this procedure, a small region of the brain is destroyed. I could see that, prior to the destruction of the neural tissue, ZIP might be injected to try to ""reset"" the synapses in that region. The drug diffuses around 1-2 mm from an injection site in the brain, so the region affected would be restricted.  For more general application, we have to develop an activity-dependent form of ZIP, i.e., a drug that becomes active only when the neurons are firing intensely, as when a memory is recalled. This might allow a specific, recalled long-term memory to be erased, rather than all long-term memories. I should add that there is a entire subfield of memory research studying the role of what is called ""reconsolidation blockade"" that aims at essentially the same thing. This work is very exciting and has been lead by my colleagues Karim Nader, Joseph LeDoux, Susan Sara, Cristina Alberini, Yadin Dudai, and others. You may have heard about the studies with propranolol on trying to reduce the emotional component of post-traumatic stress memories. How this reconsolidation work fits in with PKMzeta is actively being explored.  Developing memory enhancers that convert short- into long-term memories by increasing PKMzeta in the brain is also a possibility. This has even been done experimentally in the fruit fly by my colleagues, Jerry Yin and Eric Drier, when at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, and now at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.   Is Memory Loss Permanent?  Has the research been ongoing long enough to answer the question of permanency? Is the memory erased forever? And, further, how does the nature of the drug and its effect (physically and chemically) on the brain lead to greater understanding of how memory works. Will dementia figure in the coming research? - William H. Porter   Dr. Sacktor: Three month-old memories in the rat have been erased. Although I don't really buy the analogy, this is equivalent to a 10 year-old memory for a human (rats live around 2 years). I do not see any compelling reason why a three month-old memory would have a biologically different basis than a decades-old memory, but you never know.  We, as well as other researchers, have done extensive experiments to try to see if, once disrupted by ZIP, a memory ever comes back. We waited weeks, we gave reminders, but the memory never seemed to return. Remarkably, giving the drug right before or even during the training had no effect on long-term memory formation tested a few days later. The drug has a pure ""retrograde"" effect. That's why it's so different from clinical cases of amnesia due to brain injuries or dementias like Alzheimer's, which affect both formation of new memories and recall of old. Our experimental result also suggests that the PKMzeta is not made immediately during learning, but after a few hours, and that the drug itself only lasts a few hours.

"Many cases of so-called dementia are reversible, experts say.",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/blogs/11newoldage-when-it-175.html,"Many cases of so-called dementia are reversible, experts say.","When Jane Simpson's mother, then 91, started showing signs of memory loss in December 2007, Ms. Simpson thought age had finally caught up with her. ""As this had been a gradual process, and considering her age, we were not unduly alarmed — just saddened that it seemed we were losing my mother mentally,"" she wrote in an e-mail to this blog.  But on a visit six months later, Ms. Simpson, a 61-year-old advertising copywriter in North Carolina, was struck by how much worse her mother's memory loss had become and by her confusion about everything happening around her.  Just typical 91-year-old behavior? Just the first signs of the inevitable slide toward dementia we all may face if we live long enough? Not at all.  Since the '70s, geriatric specialists have been aware of many unusual causes of memory loss, confusion and disorientation in older people. These include not just medical conditions ranging from urinary tract infection to hydrocephalus to the flu, but also side effects from many commonly used medications.   Often, doctors and family members disregard these symptoms, thinking that they are just signs of an inevitable age-related decline. But many cases of pseudo-senility, as it's called, are reversible — if they are caught early enough.   By coincidence, Ms. Simpson had recently read a short article in her local newspaper about the side effects in the elderly of a bladder control drug called Ditropan, which include severe memory loss. Her mother was taking Ditropan.  Ms. Simpson and her sister got their mother switched to an alternative bladder control drug, Enablex. Sure enough, her mental symptoms eased. ""Within three months,"" Ms. Simpson recalled in her e-mail, ""we felt that we had our mother back.""   You'd think that with the constant attention being paid to Alzheimer's disease and other causes of memory loss in aging, doctors would have learned by now that severe memory loss in healthy aging is a problem to be diagnosed, not an inevitability to be lived with and accepted.   But according to the National Institute on Aging, missed diagnoses of reversible dementia still occur too often. ""Some physical and mental changes occur with age in healthy people,"" the agency writes in a publication called ""Forgetfulness."" ""However, much pain and suffering can be avoided if older people, their families, and their doctors recognize dementia as a disease, not part of normal aging.""  Reversible causes of dementia include the side effects of many medications. Ditropan is only the most recent addition to the list, occasioned in part by a study by U.S. Navy neurologist Dr. Jack Tsao involving 870 men and women with an average age of 75. The subjects, who were all Catholic priests, nuns and brothers, were followed for almost eight years. At a 2008 meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, Dr. Tsao reported that those who were taking anticholinergic drugs — a class that includes not only Detrol but also drugs to treat hypertension, asthma and Parkinson's disease — had a 50 percent higher rate of cognitive decline than those who were not.  According to Dr. Samuel Gandy, a neurologist at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan, drugs with antihistamines often cause mental confusion and sedation in the elderly — especially those containing the antihistamine doxylamine, such as the sleep aid Unisom. In addition, confusion and forgetfulness in the elderly can be caused by malnutrition, chronic alcoholism and metabolic disturbances such as thyroid, kidney or liver disorders — and even on occasion by something as common as dehydration or a high fever.  Doctors are better than they used to be at diagnosing pseudosenility, according to Dr. Gandy. ""Most physicians are taught in medical schools to evaluate a patient for dementia by first excluding the reversible causes,"" he said.   But one kind remains a particular problem, he added: depression masquerading as dementia. Doctors can't simply order a test to rule it out; the best they can do is recommend a trial run of antidepressant therapy, he said, ""to see if the person will perk up and come back.""   First, though, the physician must think of something other than aging as a possible cause of the symptoms.

What can countries that created lasagna and steak frites tell us about healthful eating?.,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/blogs/11well-confusio889.html,What can countries that created lasagna and steak frites tell us about healthful eating?.,"What is a Mediterranean diet anyway? This week researchers reported on a link between Mediterranean-style eating and better brain health. But every time a new report emerges on the health benefits of Mediterranean eating, many consumers are left scratching their heads. How could countries that gave us pizza, lasagna, steak frites and lamb souvlaki teach us anything about healthful eating?  Here are answers to some common questions about Mediterranean eating and health.  What foods are included in the typical Mediterranean diet?  Mediterranean eating is focused on simple cooking and includes all the foods you already eat, just in different proportions. The diet is plant-based in nature, with a heavy emphasis on fruits and vegetables, nuts, grains, seeds, beans and olive oil. Eggs, dairy, poultry and fish are consumed regularly, but the portions are smaller than typically consumed in a Western diet. Meat makes only an occasional appearance, and it's usually added in small amounts to make sauces, beans and pasta dishes more flavorful. Refined sugar and flour and butter and fats other than olive oil are consumed rarely, if at all. Mediterranean eating also typically includes moderate consumption of red wine. One of the key components of Mediterranean eating has to do with the elevation of the meal as a social event. Meals are consumed at leisure with family and friends.   ""One of the basic tenets is the enjoyment of food, and respect and pleasure of food,'' says Nicki Heverling, program manager for the Mediterranean Foods Alliance, part of Oldways, the nonprofit food issues think tank that has promoted Mediterranean eating for nearly two decades. ""When you're in the Mediterranean, your meals are three hours and you savor your food.''  Why do so many of my recipes for French, Italian and Greek foods have loads of cheese and meat in them?  The Mediterranean eating plan is based on foods that have traditionally been consumed by communities situated along the Mediterranean sea. Many of the recipes we typically associate with Mediterranean countries don't come from coastal communities, but from regions farther to the north. Today's Mediterranean diet pyramid is largely based on the dietary traditions of the Greek island of Crete and southern Italy around the 1960s, when rates of chronic disease were among the lowest in the world, and adult life expectancy was among the highest. Unfortunately, many of the communities where the diet was first studied have changed dramatically, a concern chronicled in the recent Times story ""Fast Food Hits Mediterranean; a Diet Succumbs.''   How do we know Mediterranean eating is good for you?  The original work that sparked scientific interest in Mediterranean eating habits came from researcher Ancel Keyes at the University of Minnesota. His landmark seven countries study focused on the link between eating habits along the Mediterranean and better health, despite inferior medical care in the region. Research on the diet took off in the 1990s, as scientists noted that people in Mediterranean countries lived longer and had low rates of serious disease despite high rates of smoking and drinking. Last year, the British medical journal BMJ published an extensive review of Mediterranean diet studies. It found that the eating plan is associated with significant health benefits, including lower rates of heart disease, cancer, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's. More recently, researchers found a link between Mediterranean eating and diabetes risk as well as lower blood pressure. The Oldways Web site offers a lengthy list of studies of Mediterranean eating and health.  Do I really have to eat meat only once a month?  While the traditional diet included meat only about once a month or on special occasions, most health experts say adhering to Mediterranean eating doesn't have to mean giving up meat. It just means consuming smaller portions less often. If you are packing your diet with produce, nuts, legumes and whole grains, you won't have a lot of room left on your plate for big servings of meat anyway. ""What we try to convey to people is don't cut anything out of your diet you enjoy,'' says Ms. Heverling of Oldways. ""Make smaller portions and when you have it, really enjoy it. In the traditional diet, someone wasn't eating a 12-ounce Porterhouse steak. They ate small bits of meat in a sauce. It was there to get flavor and taste from. Meat is delicious and they knew that.''  How can I learn more about Mediterranean eating?  The Web is filled with resources. Click on the links above, or visit the Oldways Web site to get started. The Mayo Clinic also offers a useful summary of the eating plan. About 150 products are labeled with the Med Mark from the Mediterranean Foods Alliance. And ""The New Mediterranean Diet Cookbook: A Delicious Alternative for Lifelong Health"" received a starred review from Publisher's Weekly and includes a foreword by New York University nutritionist Marion Nestle.  Finally, the Mediterranean diet has its own food pyramid. A version can be found on the Oldways site, or below you can find one created by the Greek Health Ministry to explain the diet. They pyramids have some differences but both support the idea that a Mediterranean diet is largely based on plant foods and whole grains.

A tribute to one Kenyan whistle-blower’s courage and a cautionary tale about the perils of challenging corruption.,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/19/books/review/Hammer-t.html,A tribute to one Kenyan whistle-blower’s courage and a cautionary tale about the perils of challenging corruption.,"Michela Wrong has built a distinguished literary career telling stories of African corruption and Western complicity. A former Africa correspondent for Reuters and The Financial Times, Wrong attracted wide attention with her first book, “In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu’s Congo,” a chronicle of societal collapse in the country then known as Zaire. She followed that with “I Didn’t Do It for You: How the World Betrayed a Small African Nation,” which told how an Eritrean rebel movement, ignored by the West, defeated a much stronger Ethiopian Army, then transmuted into an autocratic and bankrupt state. In “It’s Our Turn to Eat: The Story of a Kenyan Whistle-Blower,” her third book, Wrong’s subject is John Githongo, a newspaper journalist who became Kenya’s first anticorruption czar. Two years later, he tendered his resignation and fled the country after unearthing evidence of graft at the highest levels of government. Githongo, an old friend of Wrong’s, took refuge at her London flat and hid there for weeks while the press corps, along with Kenyan secret agents, searched the city for him in vain. Githongo’s sojourn with Wrong was the genesis of a fast-paced political thriller — with echoes of Graham Greene and John le Carré.

How yoga helped one woman survive an attack and its aftermath.,https://happydays.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/blogs/14happydays-the-art-2535.html,How yoga helped one woman survive an attack and its aftermath.,"On a misty spring night in 2005, I approached my apartment, on a tony block on the Upper West Side facing the Hudson. I felt relaxed and calm. Earlier that day I had attended a yoga workshop with a guru from India, then completed a writing assignment for a health and spirituality magazine about, as it happened, instinct - or antar-jnana, inner knowledge. I opened the outer door to my vestibule, then crossed through its inner door and into my lobby, leaving my back to the entrance. I got a prickly feeling, I don't know why. I turned. There I saw, pushing open the inner door, an ink-black, gloved hand, exaggeratedly large, controlled and deliberate. It charged toward me. It was trailed by a body, the picture of death.It is difficult for me to render the horror of the image of that man entering my building lobby that night, so great is the disparity between its emotional charge for me now and the stereotypical, almost comical picture he presented. He was a figment from a nightmare. I guessed his height and weight at 6'3"" and 230 pounds, with the physicality of a boxer. The cops later told me that was right. His clothes were dark and innocuous - clean black jeans, black sneakers, a midnight-blue hoodie - as if chosen to leave no impression whatsoever. In contrast, on his face was a neoprene thermal ski mask, the type that tents in front to create a ridge and thus evokes to most anyone who's heard of him Darth Vader. I later discovered while searching on Google that this type of mask is favored by shoppers also enamored of vigilante-style military clothing and toy AK-47s - in other words it is meant to provoke a reaction. Of the figure's actual face I saw only slit-shaped, yellowed eyes and a broad, acned, coal-black forehead.",,,The New York Times,"[{'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'thumbnail', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2009/05/22/opinion/happy75.jpg', 'height': 75, 'width': 75, 'legacy': {'thumbnail': 'images/2009/05/22/opinion/happy75.jpg', 'thumbnailwidth': 75, 'thumbnailheight': 75}, 'subType': 'thumbnail', 'crop_name': 'thumbStandard'}]",[],2009-10-15T01:25:18+0000,article,None,Blogs,Web Log,nyt://article/624891b3-69c3-5d70-bcfb-b518eac2c46e,1735,nyt://article/624891b3-69c3-5d70-bcfb-b518eac2c46e,The Art of Defying Death,Happy Days,,The Art of Defying Death,,,,By ELIZABETH KADETSKY,"[{'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'KADETSKY', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,,Alzheimer

He was a figment from a nightmare. I guessed his height and weight at 6’3” and 230 pounds, with the physicality of a boxer. The cops later told me that was right. His clothes were dark and innocuous — clean black jeans, black sneakers, a midnight-blue hoodie — as if chosen to leave no impression whatsoever. In contrast, on his face was a neoprene thermal ski mask, the type that tents in front to create a ridge and thus evokes to most anyone who’s heard of him Darth Vader. I later discovered while searching on Google that this type of mask is favored by shoppers also enamored of vigilante-style military clothing and toy AK-47s — in other words it is meant to provoke a reaction. Of the figure’s actual face I saw only slit-shaped, yellowed eyes and a broad, acned, coal-black forehead.",,,The New York Times,[],[],2009-10-15T01:25:18+0000,article,OpEd,Opinion,News,nyt://article/3bf53a05-0605-5f80-bea9-c28abae92150,1716,nyt://article/3bf53a05-0605-5f80-bea9-c28abae92150,The Art of Defying Death,Opinionator,,,,,,By Elizabeth Kadetsky,"[{'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Kadetsky', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,,Alzheimer
