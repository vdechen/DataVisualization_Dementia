"Mad cow disease may destroy the British beef industry, topple the Government  of John Major and slow the push toward European cooperation. But the most maddening thing about this waning animal epidemic is the great uncertainty about whether it poses a major or trivial threat to the health of those eating British beef.         For years the British Government insisted that there was no risk to human health. But last week, in a shocking reversal, an expert advisory committee said that mad cow disease may be ""linked"" to a handful of atypical cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare and fatal brain disease that strikes one in a  million people. Since then, the authorities have been furiously backtracking and experts have been alternately reassuring and alarmist, reflecting the dearth of  scientific knowledge about what is going on.

Nonetheless, however grounded his work may have been in the increasingly familiar styles of the Barbizon and the Hudson River Schools, it seems to have been deemed overly personal and idiosyncratic. He never found a gallery to represent him, exhibited rarely and usually to critical condemnation, struggled  without relief to support a family that included his wife, Cora, and eventually  eight children and, in desperation, frequently sold his paintings for ludicrously low amounts. In the catalogue to an exhibition at the Whitney Museum on the centenary of the artist's birth, Lloyd Goodrich, who was then associate curator at the museum, wrote that Blakelock once sold 100 paintings to a Third Avenue junk dealer for $33.
