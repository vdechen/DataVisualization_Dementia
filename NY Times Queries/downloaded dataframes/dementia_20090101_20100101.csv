"Many cases of so-called dementia are reversible, experts say.",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/blogs/11newoldage-when-it-175.html,"Many cases of so-called dementia are reversible, experts say.","When Jane Simpson's mother, then 91, started showing signs of memory loss in December 2007, Ms. Simpson thought age had finally caught up with her. ""As this had been a gradual process, and considering her age, we were not unduly alarmed — just saddened that it seemed we were losing my mother mentally,"" she wrote in an e-mail to this blog.  But on a visit six months later, Ms. Simpson, a 61-year-old advertising copywriter in North Carolina, was struck by how much worse her mother's memory loss had become and by her confusion about everything happening around her.  Just typical 91-year-old behavior? Just the first signs of the inevitable slide toward dementia we all may face if we live long enough? Not at all.  Since the '70s, geriatric specialists have been aware of many unusual causes of memory loss, confusion and disorientation in older people. These include not just medical conditions ranging from urinary tract infection to hydrocephalus to the flu, but also side effects from many commonly used medications.   Often, doctors and family members disregard these symptoms, thinking that they are just signs of an inevitable age-related decline. But many cases of pseudo-senility, as it's called, are reversible — if they are caught early enough.   By coincidence, Ms. Simpson had recently read a short article in her local newspaper about the side effects in the elderly of a bladder control drug called Ditropan, which include severe memory loss. Her mother was taking Ditropan.  Ms. Simpson and her sister got their mother switched to an alternative bladder control drug, Enablex. Sure enough, her mental symptoms eased. ""Within three months,"" Ms. Simpson recalled in her e-mail, ""we felt that we had our mother back.""   You'd think that with the constant attention being paid to Alzheimer's disease and other causes of memory loss in aging, doctors would have learned by now that severe memory loss in healthy aging is a problem to be diagnosed, not an inevitability to be lived with and accepted.   But according to the National Institute on Aging, missed diagnoses of reversible dementia still occur too often. ""Some physical and mental changes occur with age in healthy people,"" the agency writes in a publication called ""Forgetfulness."" ""However, much pain and suffering can be avoided if older people, their families, and their doctors recognize dementia as a disease, not part of normal aging.""  Reversible causes of dementia include the side effects of many medications. Ditropan is only the most recent addition to the list, occasioned in part by a study by U.S. Navy neurologist Dr. Jack Tsao involving 870 men and women with an average age of 75. The subjects, who were all Catholic priests, nuns and brothers, were followed for almost eight years. At a 2008 meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, Dr. Tsao reported that those who were taking anticholinergic drugs — a class that includes not only Detrol but also drugs to treat hypertension, asthma and Parkinson's disease — had a 50 percent higher rate of cognitive decline than those who were not.  According to Dr. Samuel Gandy, a neurologist at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan, drugs with antihistamines often cause mental confusion and sedation in the elderly — especially those containing the antihistamine doxylamine, such as the sleep aid Unisom. In addition, confusion and forgetfulness in the elderly can be caused by malnutrition, chronic alcoholism and metabolic disturbances such as thyroid, kidney or liver disorders — and even on occasion by something as common as dehydration or a high fever.  Doctors are better than they used to be at diagnosing pseudosenility, according to Dr. Gandy. ""Most physicians are taught in medical schools to evaluate a patient for dementia by first excluding the reversible causes,"" he said.   But one kind remains a particular problem, he added: depression masquerading as dementia. Doctors can't simply order a test to rule it out; the best they can do is recommend a trial run of antidepressant therapy, he said, ""to see if the person will perk up and come back.""   First, though, the physician must think of something other than aging as a possible cause of the symptoms.

A British survey finds that many family caregivers admit to instances of abuse while looking after a family member with dementia.,https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/blogs/04newoldage-elder-ab163.html,A British survey finds that many family caregivers admit to instances of abuse while looking after a family member with dementia.,"(Photo: A victim of elder abuse at a hospital in Orange County, Calif., in 2006. (Courtesy Orange County Sheriff's Dept.))   After surveying 220 adults in the United Kingdom who were tending to relatives with dementia, British researchers recently concluded that elder abuse should be viewed as a ""spectrum of behaviors rather than an all-or-nothing phenomenon."" Among other things, their findings expose an old myth — that abuse of elders happens at the hands of paid caregivers, rarely family members.  Led by Dr. Claudia Cooper, a psychiatrist at University College London, the researchers asked caregivers how often in the past three months they had acted in various psychologically and physically abusive ways toward the care recipient. The scientists relied on a common definition of elder abuse used in both the U.K. and in the United States: harming an older person psychologically, financially, physically or by neglect.  More than half of the family caregivers reported having engaged in some abusive behavior — including screaming, insulting or cursing — directed at the person in their care, the researchers found. More than a quarter of the respondents had ""at least sometimes"" screamed or yelled at their cognitively impaired relatives, and just shy of 20 percent said they had used a harsh tone, or had insulted or sworn at their charges.  Less common, but not unheard of, were instances in which caregivers threatened impaired relatives with nursing home placement or abandonment, or hit or shook them. Some 1.4 percent admitted that they had engaged in significant physical abuse.    The backdrop to this study raises some interesting questions, and I'd like to hear your thoughts on them. The British government has been reviewing current policy for safeguarding vulnerable adults, and both the existing policy and the review have been focused entirely on preventing abuse by paid caregivers. Dr. Gill Livingston, a professor psychiatry at University College London and a co-author of the study, said that any strategy for protecting this helpless group ""must be directed toward families who provide the majority of care for older people, rather than exclusively at paid caregivers.""  And an interesting footnote: while the new study makes no effort to measure the frequency of financial abuse, it arrives just as Anthony Marshall, son of the late socialite and philanthropist Brooke Astor, is scheduled to stand trial in Manhattan Criminal Court on charges that he defrauded his mother of millions of dollars in cash and valuables at a time when she was mentally incompetent. Mrs. Astor died in 2007 at the age of 105. The criminal trial of Mr. Marshall, 84, follows an earlier court proceeding in which a judge determined that claims of elder abuse against him were unsubstantiated.

"With a family history of Alzheimer's disease, even minor memory lapses can be terrifying.",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/17/blogs/17newoldage-knowing-181.html,"With a family history of Alzheimer's disease, even minor memory lapses can be terrifying.","(Photo: Carmel Zucker for The New York TimesThe author at work in her home office in 2007. With a family history of Alzheimer's disease, even occasional lapses in memory cause her to worry.)   This morning I couldn't remember the street number of my house. My own house! Don't panic, I thought, don't struggle to remember it. Just go on with other things, and it'll float to the surface. But it didn't, so I opened the front door and read the street numbers aloud, trying to fix them in my brain.  Lots of people have these lapses, I know. But one week ago, I was sitting with my mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, in a memory care center in Honolulu. We were in the ""living room"" filled with 20 Benjamin Buttons, 20 people aging backward, regressing to infancy. Not in body, as in the movie, but in mind.   One woman who'd been a political journalist sat hugging a teddy bear. ""What is your full name?"" a nurses' assistant asked the group. Half of them shook their heads, baffled. My mother remembers her name but sometimes thinks I'm her older sister. She seems happy, though, as she eats dinner with the group in silence before they're herded to the parlor to watch a DVD of ""The Parent Trap."" She's not suffering, but I am, feeling heartsick every time I drive away.   Not only my mother but both her parents had dementia and were institutionalized. So when I have a lapse like today's, I ask myself, ""Is it starting?""   There's a blood test one can take that shows if you carry a gene that's a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Should I take it? My gut reaction is no, since there's no cure or way to prevent the disease.  Nonetheless, I do research on the genetics of Alzheimer's. According to a report by the Alzheimer's Disease Education and Referral Center, no gene has been identified as the cause of late-onset Alzheimer's, which occurs after 60. (That's not late for this reporter; it's now!) But one genetic risk factor has been confirmed by many studies to increase the likelihood of developing the disease. That risk factor is the gene variant APOE4, found on chromosome 19. If you carry this variant, you're more prone to develop Alzheimer's disease -- 40 percent of people with the disease have APOE4, according to the report.  On the other hand, you may not develop Alzheimer's even if you test positive for APOE4, and if you don't carry the gene, you still may contract the disease.  I make a list of the pro's and con's of testing for APOE4.  PRO:  1. Information is power. Dr. Lenny Guarente, a biology professor at M.I.T. who studies genes that may determine how long we live, says people who test positive for APOE4 often ""handle the information well."" Many prefer to know and adjust to the fact than live with doubts.  2. You can make plans. During my yearly physical, I told my doctor I'm worried about memory loss because dementia runs in my family. He suggested I tell my children how I'd want to be cared for if the need should arise. Ideally, I'd like to be cared for in my home or in a place with some of my friends, where there are animals and gardens, good books read aloud, spiritual talks, music and films better than ""The Parent Trap."" But I don't know of such a place. If I learned that I carry the risk factor for Alzheimer's, I might be propelled to find or create such a situation while I'm still able.  CON:  1. The body is mysterious. Spontaneous healing can occur, and disease can strike people in peak health. In Alzheimer's disease, it's believed that several genes combine with environmental factors to bring on the disease, so why focus on one gene that may or may not be the trigger?   2. We're dealing not with the present but the future. Who knows what medical advances will occur in the next 20 years? Who knows if there'll even be life on the planet?  I could go back and forth, but the salient question is, would I conduct my life differently if I knew I was at risk? Probably not. Still, it would be a terrific comfort to find out I do not have the gene. But is that comfort worth gambling on the far more likely result — learning that I do carry it?  I had an uncle, Art, who in his 80s used to write his address on the back of his hand, explaining with a laugh that if he forgot his address, he'd be able to get home. At the time I thought he was joking, but now I know he was not.   And he never developed Alzheimer's.   Sara Davidson is the author of ""Leap: What Will We Do With the Rest of Our Lives?""

Nobody in the article disputes the possibility that moderate drinking can be beneficial. Those interviewed simply make the compelling argument that too many variables exist in the research to conclude that moderate wine consumption is the reason for any healthful findings. Obviously, the wine industry is hugely vested in the idea that a daily glass or two is good for the health. Wine Spectator  regularly highlights studies that depict wine as a healthy beverage (its Web site currently includes an article suggesting that a glass or two of wine a day may prevent gallstones). Indeed, the tremendous growth in American red wine consumption in the 1990s was largely due to reports of the French paradox, the idea that the French, with a diet relatively high in fat have a lower incidence of heart disease than Americans. The paradox held that consumption of red wine may be what reduces heart disease in France. Personally speaking, whether wine is good for me or not has nothing to do with why I drink it. I drink wine because I love it. I do not believe that moderate consumption is bad for me. I think drinking wine is in fact good for me because it gives me pleasure and makes me happy, and I believe that people who are happy tend to be healthier than people who are unhappy. But does it have a direct effect on aspects of health? Who can say? I have worked at The New York Times for 25 years (come September) and I can't tell you how many health studies I have read in that time that haven't come close to being conclusive. Remember the oat bran fad? Twenty years ago some study indicated oat bran might help lower cholesterol. Instant mania. Instant marketing. Instant profits. Until people realized that oat bran was not nearly all it was baked up to be. It's always the same way. Fads and fears come and go, and the real wisdom is always the same: Eat, drink and live how you like, but do so in moderation. Exercise, don't smoke, and you know the rest. Enjoy wine because it gives pleasure, not because it's a panacea for heart disease, gallstones, dementia or anything else.",,,The New York Times,[],[],2009-06-16T15:56:37+0000,article,None,Blogs,,Web Log,nyt://article/d4b6d4f6-9b42-502d-9850-fd937db357b8,393,nyt://article/d4b6d4f6-9b42-502d-9850-fd937db357b8,Health Benefit?

A Mediterranean-style diet appears to be good for the brain as well as the heart.,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/blogs/10well-mediterr885.html,A Mediterranean-style diet appears to be good for the brain as well as the heart.,"Eating a Mediterranean diet appears to lower risk for mental decline, and may help prevent Alzheimer's in people with existing memory problems, new research suggests.  The finding, published today in The Archives of Neurology, tracked the eating habits of 1,393 people with no cognitive problems and 482 patients with mild cognitive impairment, a preliminary state of mental decline that can sometimes signal the onset of Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. The patients were then grouped based on whether they were low, moderate or consistent followers of a Mediterranean diet. People were considered to be strong adherents to a Mediterranean-style diet if they regularly ate large amounts of fish, fruits, vegetables, legumes and monounsaturated fats like olive oil, while at the same time consuming moderate amounts of alcohol and only small quantities of meat and dairy products.  After nearly five years of follow up, about 275 people in the healthy group developed mild cognitive impairment. People who closely adhered to a Mediterranean diet had a 28 percent lower risk of developing mild cognitive impairment, compared to those whose eating habits were the least like a Mediterranean diet. Moderate followers of a Mediterranean diet showed a trend toward a 17 percent lower risk than the lowest-scoring group, although that finding wasn't statistically significant.  A Mediterranean diet also appeared to slow decline in those already diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment. Among the 482 men and women with mild cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study, 106 developed Alzheimer's disease about four years later. But among those who strictly adhered to the Mediterranean diet, risk of Alzheimer's was 48 percent lower, while risk was 45 percent lower among those who ate a moderate version of the diet.  It's not clear from the study how long the participants had been following a Mediterranean eating plan. However, the researchers said that older people tend to be fairly set in their ways and stick to eating patterns that have been established years earlier, so it's likely the habits were established at least in middle age. The average age of study participants was 77.  Because the study was observational and not a controlled clinical trial, the association of better brain aging with the consumption of a Mediterranean diet isn't definitive and could be explained by other factors. However, researchers note that a Mediterranean diet has already been shown to be good for the heart, and there is no risk in improving eating habits in the hope of improving brain health as well.  ""We know it's a healthy diet for other reasons,'' said lead author Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, assistant professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Center. ""It makes sense for people to eat in a healthy way as soon as they can and for the longest they possibly can.''

A doctor with the incoming administration's ear is urging a return to in-home care for the elderly.,https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/12/blogs/12newoldage-why-hous145.html,A doctor with the incoming administration's ear is urging a return to in-home care for the elderly.,"Dr. Jack Resnick, an internist in New York, believes that if the frail elderly are treated at home by doctors making house calls, as they did in the good old days, then medical outcomes will improve and Medicare costs can be reduced. Dr. Resnick hosted one of the community health care forums arranged by the Obama transition team on Dec. 29 at the Good Shepherd Community Center on Roosevelt Island in New York City. The following week, Dr. Resnick brought his message to the state capitol in Albany, where he met with health officials responsible for long-term care policy.  Dr. Resnick's own anecdotal experience with house calls has been documented in various medical journals, which report that keeping geriatric patients out of the hospital reduces costs between 30 and 60 percent. With Medicare cost-containment high on the agenda of the incoming administration, I asked Dr. Resnick to share his thoughts. For a different perspective on house calls, you can hear first-hand from his patients at therooseveltdoctor.com. — Jane Gross   Eleven years ago, I started a general internal medicine practice on Roosevelt Island, a small community in the East River connected to Manhattan by subway and an aerial cable car. The island, a planned community started in 1975, had set aside apartments for the homebound, disabled and frail elderly. Soon after I opened my practice, I started getting requests for house calls from people who had been medically isolated — some for decades. I now spend almost a third of my time on house calls to 50 of these people. Most are homebound, quite a few are on respirators, all have multiple chronic illnesses.   My patients have taught me a lot — about how to treat them in particular and about the American health care system in general.  We all recognize that the American health care system is broken and needs to be fixed. Most of the discussion of health care reform focuses on its financing: the uninsured, the underinsured and the difficulty that even the insured face in negotiating its complexities. But even if every American were insured, the system would continue to deliver inadequate care at exorbitant cost. While solving the problem of the uninsured is necessary, it is far from sufficient.  Here are the two changes needed to address the system's failures.   First, everyone must have a single doctor in charge of his care. This doctor should know the person intimately, have immediate access to all of his medical information and must be available around the clock.   Second, much of health care that is now delivered in institutions — hospitals and nursing home — should be provided at home.   I've come to these conclusions over the last decade treating my severely ill patients on Roosevelt Island. Early on, I would try to hospitalize my patients when they developed a severe illness. They would resist mightily, and I soon understood why. They all had had experiences as in-patients and knew well the perils of the hospital. I quickly discovered that a hospital stay for these people almost always left them worse off than before they had been admitted.   The price of getting some intravenous antibiotics for pneumonia, for example, often included bedsores, antibiotic-resistant hospital-acquired infections, medication errors, delirium and dementia.  It's not unusual for one of my patients to wind up in a hospital without my knowledge after a call to 911. In those instances, they almost always wind up in a nursing home after the treatment of their acute illness. Soon, their hospital-acquired confusion and delirium — generally a temporary state — turns into ""dementia"" because the nursing home doctors label them that way. Several times I have had the good fortune of finding one of these ""demented"" people in a nursing home and seen them return to normalcy within a few weeks of returning to the familiar environment of their home.   I've worked very hard to move more of health care into the home. I encounter many barriers.   · Intravenous medication — While it is not difficult to arrange intravenous medication at home for people who need expensive chemotherapy drugs, providing life-sustaining intravenous saline and sugar water on an urgent basis is extremely difficult because the companies that provide both are not set up for on-the-spot delivery. The providers of home-based intravenous treatments make their money on the payments they receive for the substances they infuse. Expensive cancer drugs are much more lucrative than simple antibiotics and salt water.   · Caregivers — The home health aides and attendants are crucial to the survival of my patients. Many times I've seen my charges deteriorate rapidly when a reliable aide leaves their service. One of my patients had been cared for by the same aide for eight years. When the aide had to take a medical leave for a gynecologic procedure, the patient deteriorated rapidly and developed life-threatening urinary tract infections. Even more dramatic was his return to health when, after a three-month absence, his aide returned. Within two weeks, an almost fatal illness had turned around and he was back to his usual self. These caregivers are woefully underpaid and underutilized. They need improved pay scales, broader training, increased responsibilities and a career ladder that will attract and keep them in this vital profession.   · Exercise and physical therapy — Among the most destructive limitations on care at home for the chronically ill are the rules surrounding physical therapy. Patients can only get physical therapy after they have suffered some loss of function. Their exercise program ends when they have gained back as much function as possible. No maintenance therapy is allowed by Medicare. Inevitably, without exercise they lose function again, and a new round of rehabilitation starts. Unfortunately, each of these cycles usually ends with the patient at a lower level of functioning than at the beginning of treatment. It's truly penny-wise and pound-foolish to not provide a constant exercise program.   · Electronic medical records — Several years ago I invested in an electronic medical record for my practice. Now, wherever I am — in a patient's home, on rounds in the hospital, or visiting my grandchildren in Boston — all of their information is in front of me. This is one barrier I've successfully removed. I recommend E.M.R.'s highly to all.   · Early advance planning — I've started putting a lot of energy into getting my patients to talk to their family, friends and caregivers about how they want to be treated. Too often a well-meaning but frightened person calls 911, and one of my patients winds up worse off as they encounter the mishaps of institutional care. Getting all of these concerned people to have early discussions with my patients about how they want to be treated has begun to pay off in longer lives, less illness and more happiness.   · Real-time audio-video access — I've begun to investigate how the Internet can improve care at home. Live Webcam access would allow me to better assess a patient's urgent problem and provide reassurance at a time of great stress. It would allow close monitoring of someone getting acute treatment in the home. And it would make it easier to have a consultant evaluate one of my homebound patients without requiring arduous transportation via ambulance or ambulette.   How do we pay for all of this? Studies have shown that good home-based care dramatically reduces the amount of time people spend in hospitals. A small fraction of the savings generated would cover all of the costs these changes would require.   An even larger question is how do we find physicians who want to commit themselves to such a career, with its huge demands on their time, energies and emotions. The answer is simple. Let them share in those savings so that they earn as much as their colleagues in other specialties.

Dr. Todd C. Sacktor answers readers' questions about research into the selective erasure of memory.,https://consults.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/13/blogs/13consults-memory-e117.html,Dr. Todd C. Sacktor answers readers' questions about research into the selective erasure of memory.,"What would your life be like if you could erase certain memories? Maybe you could ""forget"" about some traumatic event, a deep-seated fear or a relationship gone wrong.   It seems like science fiction, but researchers may be on the verge of making memory erasure a reality.  (Photo: Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times Dr. Todd C. Sacktor)   Dr. Todd C. Sacktor and his team of scientists from SUNY Downstate Medical Center have been able to show how a single dose of an experimental drug can block the ability of an animal's brain to hold onto specific types of memories.   To read more about Dr. Sacktor's work, read Benedict Carey's article, ""Brain Researchers Open Door to Editing Memory.""   Dr. Sacktor's research raises some interesting questions. How will erasing specific memories affect humans? Will this work lead to a treatment to allow us to retain memory longer?   This week, Dr. Sacktor will answer your questions about memory erasure. Please post your questions and comments below, and check back daily for his responses.    In Response to the Ethical Questions  This strikes me as one of those things that could be extremely dangerous if used improperly. Even ignoring the potential illegal uses, allowing people to erase negative memories is a bad idea.   I'm in general disinclined to promote any kind of ignorance - even if that ignorance would make a person happier. We learn from the past, right? Well, we're supposed to. And sometimes it is learning from painful memories that we become better people.  The only time I can imagine this being okay is in cases of serious, horrendous trauma - rape victims who now cannot live normal lives, child abuse victims, etc. Only in situations where a person has been completely destroyed from an experience, where there is nothing positive to learn. But even then, we are denying reality, denying life. And for better or worse, our memories define who we are.  - James W., Washington D.C.    Dr. Sacktor: The purpose of our experiment with ZIP was to try to understand the molecular basis of memory storage, which previously was a complete scientific mystery. The experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that memories are stored by the action of a specific molecule- PKMzeta. You should know that the notion that a specific molecule stores memory goes completely against the grain of how most neuroscientists have thought about long-term memory for decades. Most neuroscientists thought that memories were stored by anatomical changes in the brain, such as new synapses, not by specific molecules. That is why our results showing a very rapid disruption of long-term memories, first published in Science in 2006, were so striking. The results have been confirmed in many labs around the world, with different drugs that inhibit PKMzeta, and for many different forms of long-term memory. Interestingly, ZIP does not affect short-term memory, or once the drug is gone, the formation of new long-term memories in the same brain region.  Elucidating the molecular mechanism of long-term memory may one day be key, I hope, to developing treatments of memory disorders. But don't forget how long this development from basic science discovery to clinical usefulness takes- decades for even the most important findings, such as germ theory and the structure of DNA.  One important recent publication by my colleagues at SUNY Downstate, Drs. Sue Mirra, John Crary, and Charles Shao, is that PKMzeta is bound up in the neurofibrillary tangles that are found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's Disease. This is likely to alter the function of PKMzeta and may contribute to the memory loss characteristic of that disorder.  But I think that the concerns, even the deep unease, that many of the questions voice reflect two striking features of the experiments with ZIP that go to the essence of PKMzeta's role in memory- features that are also rather surprising to most neuroscientists. These are, first, the rapidity with which long-term memories, three month-old in the rats and presumably decades-old in humans, might be erased. This happens almost immediately with the injection of the drug. Second, is the specificity. As I mentioned, short-term memory, the underlying structure of the brain, and the capacity to form new long-term memories are unaffected.  These two surprising features are because PKMzeta is an enzyme. If you recall from high-school biology, there are two general forms of proteins, structural and enzymatic. Most neuroscientists had assumed that hundreds of structural proteins would be involved in the new synapses thought to store long-term memory. And there would be nothing unique to the structural proteins in the memory-storing synapses, as opposed to those synapses formed in development prior to experience.  But enzymes catalyze very specific chemical reactions and can be rapidly inhibited. That long-term memories are maintained by the constant action of one such enzyme, and thus that memories can be specifically and rapidly erased, was quite a shock.   The Drug's Uses  What are the primary uses you envision for this drug?  - Rebecka L., New Jersey   Dr. Sacktor: There are a few rare or severe cases of psychiatric or neurological disease in which ZIP might be helpful. I am a neurologist, not a psychiatrist, but I understand that there are clinical situations in which, as a last resort, a procedure known as bilateral cingulotomy can be performed. In this procedure, a small region of the brain is destroyed. I could see that, prior to the destruction of the neural tissue, ZIP might be injected to try to ""reset"" the synapses in that region. The drug diffuses around 1-2 mm from an injection site in the brain, so the region affected would be restricted.  For more general application, we have to develop an activity-dependent form of ZIP, i.e., a drug that becomes active only when the neurons are firing intensely, as when a memory is recalled. This might allow a specific, recalled long-term memory to be erased, rather than all long-term memories. I should add that there is a entire subfield of memory research studying the role of what is called ""reconsolidation blockade"" that aims at essentially the same thing. This work is very exciting and has been lead by my colleagues Karim Nader, Joseph LeDoux, Susan Sara, Cristina Alberini, Yadin Dudai, and others. You may have heard about the studies with propranolol on trying to reduce the emotional component of post-traumatic stress memories. How this reconsolidation work fits in with PKMzeta is actively being explored.  Developing memory enhancers that convert short- into long-term memories by increasing PKMzeta in the brain is also a possibility. This has even been done experimentally in the fruit fly by my colleagues, Jerry Yin and Eric Drier, when at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, and now at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.   Is Memory Loss Permanent?  Has the research been ongoing long enough to answer the question of permanency? Is the memory erased forever? And, further, how does the nature of the drug and its effect (physically and chemically) on the brain lead to greater understanding of how memory works. Will dementia figure in the coming research? - William H. Porter   Dr. Sacktor: Three month-old memories in the rat have been erased. Although I don't really buy the analogy, this is equivalent to a 10 year-old memory for a human (rats live around 2 years). I do not see any compelling reason why a three month-old memory would have a biologically different basis than a decades-old memory, but you never know.  We, as well as other researchers, have done extensive experiments to try to see if, once disrupted by ZIP, a memory ever comes back. We waited weeks, we gave reminders, but the memory never seemed to return. Remarkably, giving the drug right before or even during the training had no effect on long-term memory formation tested a few days later. The drug has a pure ""retrograde"" effect. That's why it's so different from clinical cases of amnesia due to brain injuries or dementias like Alzheimer's, which affect both formation of new memories and recall of old. Our experimental result also suggests that the PKMzeta is not made immediately during learning, but after a few hours, and that the drug itself only lasts a few hours.

(Courtesy Intel Corp.))    My colleague John Leland, writing from the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, sent us these musings on the first-ever exhibit there devoted to technology aimed at the elderly, their adult children and their medical providers. He would like to pursue this subject in the future, so if you've had some experience, good or bad, with technological innovations intended for seniors, please post below. We welcome the thoughts of all concerned digerati, parents and children, old and not-so-old. — Jane Gross  At the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, I stepped onto an ordinary-looking white bathroom scale. The scale sent a signal via Bluetooth to a control box, which read my weight aloud.   It was my first time on the scale. We had no relationship. I was just data. The machine was just a disembodied voice.  Then Mikael Hvid, application manager at Tunstall Healthcare A/S, which makes the box, stepped onto the scale. After telling Mr. Hvid his weight, the voice compared the figure with previous readings.   Then it got inquisitive.   ""Are you more tired than usual?"" it asked.   Mr. Hvid was. (This was Las Vegas, after all.) He pressed a ""yes"" button.   ""Are you having trouble sleeping at night?"" Ditto.  Mr. Hvid's weight and answers were all harvested by the box's software, which stood ready to make them available electronically to whomever he gave access: his primary care doctor, family members, perhaps a pulmonologist, maybe the administrators at his assisted living community.   The control box also works with gadgets measuring blood pressure, oxygen level, activity level and other markers of health. If the person on the scale were my mother, I might instruct the box to alert me if her weight rose or fell by a certain amount, or if her answers to questions suggested trouble. Other devices in the exhibition hall tracked whether a user fell, opened a pill bottle, made coffee, used the bathroom excessively at night or wandered out of the home.   In a nutshell, this was the big idea about aging at this year's C.E.S.: how to use mostly simple technologies to gather information and detect warning signs, thereby allowing older people to remain in their own homes with fewer trips to the doctor's office and less need for supervision in a skilled nursing facility.    I imagined my mother's doctors all having a single report that showed how a change in her medication coincided with changes in weight, blood pressure, mood, sleep pattern and gait, then being able to discuss that information with one another, family members and my mother. That would be a big step forward for her and for many like her.  But then I imagined my mother living with a half-dozen electronic boxes beeping for attention and me getting alerts every time one of the measurements was skewed — me, without the medical expertise to sort the blips from the real problems. I'd call her doctor and become ensnared in a voicemail loop that asked if I was more tired than usual and if I was having trouble sleeping at night.   Yes, and heck yes. With technology like this, I might never sleep again.  These devices were unveiled at a day-long program called the Silvers Summit, the first forum at the C.E.S. dedicated to aging. Participants included hospitals, nonprofit groups, retailers, insurers and dozens of entrepreneurs, many of whom got involved after personally experiencing what it is like to care for an elderly relative in decline. Presenters said the technology is aimed not at old people but at their children.  ""The fact that we're in C.E.S. and we're not just one booth means we're getting somewhere,"" said Eric Dishman, the global director of product research and innovation at the Intel Digital Health Group. ""Seven or eight years ago, no one even talked about aging. Something tipped.""   Topics ranged from mental exercise programs for fending off dementia to phones for people with diminished hearing and dexterity. Most of the devices shown were not covered by insurance, and either in prototype or not widely used.   ""Our society does not reimburse for prevention,"" said David Stern, chief professional officer for Living Independently, which produces a home monitoring system called QuietCare that is used in assisted living communities. ""But there's a recognition now that people need technology and that if you can keep someone living at home, it costs a lot less than having them in a nursing home.""   Mr. Stern could not say how much QuietCare cost because each facility programs different features into it. Another system on display, GrandCare, costs $2,300 for the basic equipment, then $25 to $50 a month for the company to manage the flow of data. With GrandCare, relatives can upload photographs, appointments or messages to a device in an elder's home that looks like a television with a touchscreen.   Mr. Stern said the home monitoring technology answered competing needs: ""An older person in assisted living wants to maximize independence. But the expectations of family members and state regulators are that she is going to be made secure 24/7. How do you do both? Technology is the answer. It's the only way they can be secure and independent without someone coming in and checking up on them.""   All vendors said their products were not meant to replace human contact with doctors or family members. But technology has unintended consequences. For some older people, the experience of having blood pressure checked can be the only human touch of the day. An automated home device can take the blood pressure and save the health care system hundreds of dollars, but it does not replace a living, breathing visitor or conversation with fellow patients during otherwise annoying doctor visits.   At one of the forum presentations, Dr. Hyung Tai Kim, a vice president of research at Ascension Health, a Catholic hospital system, identified two potential stumbling blocks for the devices. They called for doctors trained to treat patients in person to make judgments based on data gathered remotely. And current insurance programs do not compensate the doctors for these analyses.   Some of these gadgets will prove useful. Many others will become the home treadmills of the future — developed and purchased in good faith, but in practice unused. Mr. Dishman of Intel described a pillbox that alerted users every day at the same time that they needed to take a pill, even if they had already taken it. As a result, people didn't use it, he said.  ""No one wants to be nagged or be embarrassed by something that makes them look like they can't take care of themselves,"" he said. ""We switched to one that was more responsive to whether you already took the pill, and we quadrupled compliance.""  ""Those little tweaks go a long way,"" he added.  The prototypes are now out there. Let the grumbling and tweaking begin.

"Advice received at unexpected moments, often from strangers, has turned out to be the most effective counsel of all.",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/blogs/26newoldage-the-kind173.html,"Advice received at unexpected moments, often from strangers, has turned out to be the most effective counsel of all.","As I was moving my widowed mother from a retirement community in Alabama to a nursing home near me in New Jersey, there was a particularly awkward moment on our flight when, somewhere over Philadelphia, she had to use the bathroom.   My mother, then 78, had dementia and balance problems and couldn't walk without help. Arm in arm, we inched up the aisle, lurching with the turbulence. Somehow, I steered her into the tiny stall and onto the toilet seat, then squeezed myself inside so as to close the door and give her some privacy. Suffice it to say that it's a lot easier to change a baby's diaper than a mother's Depends in an airplane bathroom.  (Photo: The author and her mother, Irene Russakoff, in a snapshot taken in 1998, the year she arrived at a New Jersey nursing home.)   A flight attendant caught my eye as we returned to our seats and gave me a knowing, sympathetic smile. On the ground in Newark, as I settled my mother into a wheelchair for the ride down the jetway into an uncharted stage of her life (and mine), that flight attendant touched my shoulder and said one sentence that I remember to this day: ""Just don't hurry.""  Her advice caught me off guard because it was so different from the conversations I'd had with myself about this new responsibility. I had a demanding job, a husband, two young children, a dog and a house, and now I had a mother to take care of, too. In order to keep up, I had to do everything faster, right? Wrong, this woman was saying.   I heard her voice in my head many times in my mother's last six years as she became sicker and needed me more and more. ""Just don't hurry"" became a way of willing myself to be calm when I was with her, no matter how distressing the challenges. As years passed, everything took her more time — dressing, eating, talking, getting in and out of wheelchairs and, yes, going to the bathroom. ""Just don't hurry"" helped me experience life at my mother's pace and understand a little better what she was facing.  Anyone who cares for an aging parent gets no shortage of unsolicited advice. But every now and then, one comment resonates — and helps, again and again. This was the first of several that I came to value.   Another came from a nurse at the nursing home where my mother spent those final six years. My mother had deep bouts of depression, which medication wasn't helping, and at various points I was visiting almost nightly just to keep her company. I was losing sleep, and I'm sure I looked as stressed out as I felt.  One night, a nurse named Ann, who had that nurse's knack for being crisp and caring at the same time, looked sternly at me and said, ""You know, your mother could live another 20 years. And if she does, you won't."" She said it with such authority that she scared me. And I realized suddenly that Ann was right: no way could I do this for 20 years. (As I said, my mother lived only six.)  I didn't stop responding to my mother, but I came less often — usually one weeknight and weekends. She ultimately accepted that, restoring my life expectancy.  Still, I was often the first target for her frustration, and one night my mother lashed out at me in front of her brother and his wife, who were visiting from New Mexico. I don't remember what triggered this, but I do recall my Aunt Sherry saying softly from behind me, ""Be a duck.""   Baffled, I turned around to see her very discreetly miming a duck letting water roll off its back. This was so comical, and so supportive, that it short-circuited the hurt and anger welling up inside me. ""Be a duck"" became a handy mental trick to stop myself from sweating the small stuff.  My younger son, then 7, delivered some helpful advice unintentionally one night when he asked, ""Mommy, when you get old, are you going to be like Nana?"" I remember saying something to try to ease his fears, but I also remember realizing all at once that my role as caregiver wasn't just for my mother's benefit. For better or worse, my children were watching carefully and would draw big, possibly lifelong lessons from what they witnessed. Caregiving felt less lonely when I thought of it as trying to be a good mother instead of just a good daughter.  In the last year of her life, my mother lost the ability to speak. On visits, I tried to fill the silences with whatever I thought would interest her, but the one-way conversation seemed only to accentuate her isolation, rather than relieving it. I mentioned this to a colleague, who suggested I call his wife, Suzanne Southworth, then a clinical psychologist consulting with nursing homes in the Washington area. ""People communicate all the time without words,"" Suzanne said.  Instantly, I thought of plenty of nonverbal ways we could communicate. My mother had been an avid gardener when I was a child, so I bought her an amaryllis, and each time I visited, we would look at it together and marvel at how it seemed to grow literally before our eyes. She also was an art enthusiast, and we paged through her many art books, admiring Impressionists, Expressionists, Cubists and more. My father had been a jazz trumpet player in his spare time, and we listened to tapes of him and his combo playing ""It Might as Well Be Spring,"" ""Summertime"" and dozens of big band standards. We also looked at her many photo albums.  The last time I saw my mother alive, we happened to look at her pictures of my 7-year-old birthday party. I was holding a brand new Beatles album above my head, and all my friends and I were squealing some form of Beatlemania. ""Oh my God, Mom, do you remember that?!"" I exclaimed. She gave a huge nod, her eyes glistened and we both threw back our heads and laughed out loud.  One sentence of advice from Suzanne gave us back our common ground, our mother-daughter mutuality.

Many caregivers learn the hard way that there are no perfect solutions.,https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/22/blogs/22newoldage-th-good-157.html,Many caregivers learn the hard way that there are no perfect solutions.,"Not long ago, following a reader's suggestion, I found the Web site SilverPlanet, one of a growing number of online destinations for leading-edge Baby Boomers that offers information, blogs and resources on subjects such as health, finances and entertainment.   The site is a bit busy for my taste, trying to be all things to all people, but I was immediately drawn to the title of one blog: ""A Good Enough Daughter'' by Sara Myers, who has 30 years of professional experience in the field of aging at the National Adult Day Services Association and the Washington Adult Day Services Association — and about a year of personal experience as a family caregiver for her 90-year-old mother.   There is an old saying about not letting the perfect drive out the good, a notion that I think is essential to providing sensible and loving care to an aging parent and maintaining one's sanity during the process. I tell friends and colleagues who enter this parallel universe to realize that there are many different trajectories to this experience but only one endpoint.   Your mother or father, regardless of what you do or don't do, will die.   Blunt? You betcha. Unwelcome information? To many of you, I suspect so. But also liberating — permission to not let the perfect drive out the good.   As the adult child with an ailing parent, you are faced with many choices, and more often than not, you don't have a clue which is the right one. Slowly — very, very slowly — I have come to see there is rarely a ""right"" or ""wrong"" decision when the goal is not to prolong life but rather to enhance its quality. At least, there is certainly not a ""right"" or ""wrong"" medical decision.   During the years spent caring for my own mother, that realization meant I could focus my energy on being kind, consoling and attentive. I could bear witness and stop trying to fix things, could commiserate more and worry less. That would be good enough, maybe better than good enough. It would not be perfect, and that was O.K.   I contacted Ms. Myers and asked her how she had chosen the title to her blog. Below is her reply, a version of which she used to introduce herself last June. And be sure to read two of her posts, ""Aunt Babe Died: What Do I Tell My Mother?"" and ""The Sacred Cloth."" I enjoyed them and hope you will, too. ¬— Jane Gross    By Sara Myers  I am 57 years old and have two sons, ages 20 and 16, and have a fine job that I have held for almost 15 years. When my 90-year-old mother took a series of falls about a year ago while living in Phoenix, it was my job as the only daughter and ""professional in aging"" to fly to Phoenix (from my home on Bainbridge Island, Washington) and do whatever was necessary to make everything right.   My mother lived in Phoenix for over 60 years. When I arrived at her home, she made clear that she wasn't about to move or accept help. Realizing that I could not wrap her up in bubble wrap and ship her to my hometown, I took a deep breath and decided to do what I could. I visited with doctors and talked to friends and neighbors. I brought in the home care workers (against protest), ""equity loaned"" the house, and fixed and fixed and fixed. I did whatever I could do to make the situation safe, while complying with my mother's adamantly held decision to never leave her home.   Four falls, four hospitalizations, six months and 30,000 frequent flyers miles later, I made the decision: mom had to move near me. The latest fall took my mother into a nearby rehabilitation center. It was crummy at best. I guess the rehabilitation services were probably up to par, but the facility was late-60's architecture and while the staff was pleasant enough, they always seemed busy doing something other than actually taking care of a resident. I walked into my mother's room, and she said to me, ""Get me out of here. I'm ready to move to Bainbridge.""   I quickly put my geriatric case manager hat on and began to plan the move. I had plenty of work to do. I had to pack up as many of my mother's things as I could and ship them to Bainbridge and find a rehabilitation center near my home that had an opening. It was a whirlwind experience. Thank God for my friends Jo and Kathy, who helped me work out all of the details.   I thought it would be less stressful to have Mom near me. I did not exactly work out that way. I made daily visits, conducted chart reviews, talked with staff, and reported to my brothers and to my mother's 100 friends, all while working and trying to pay some attention to my family. I quickly became slightly insane.  Whatever it was I was doing revealed to My Dear Husband that I was going over the edge. My mood was unpredictable. I became demanding and emotionally needy. My Dear Husband sat me down and suggested that my recent weight gain was related to caregiving stress and that I should consider something, anything. I listened to him and realized that something had to give — and it was not going to be my health or sanity. I had to give up the idea that I could make it all right, that I could make my mother feel good about leaving Phoenix, that I could magically make her walk independently again. I decided that all I could do was be a good enough daughter — not perfect, but good enough.   My mother is on her way to her 91st birthday. Dementia is definitely part of the picture, but other than that, she's in pretty good shape. She may live for years. In the past year, I have learned that there is no such thing as a perfect caregiver or perfect daughter or perfect son. Just when we think we have a plan, just when we think we have it all figured out, everything changes: a fall, a no-show paid caregiver, an irate sister or brother, a placement option that doesn't work, or a medication that turns everything upside down. I think we should try to do the best we can, when we can. We should strive for good, sufficient, satisfactory, helpful, and healthy, or okay — never perfect. Perfect does not exit in the world of family caregiving.

One model for long-term care is earning much-deserved praise.,https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/08/blogs/08newoldage-health-c141.html,One model for long-term care is earning much-deserved praise.,"Hardly anyone has a good word to say about this country's fragmented system for delivering and paying for long-term care, with one exception: the PACE program, which many experts laud as long-term care done right.  PACE, an acronym for ""program of all-inclusive care for the elderly,"" provides anything and everything a frail elderly person and her family might need, coordinated by a team of medical and social service providers, for an annual fee generally paid by Medicare and Medicaid. The care can be delivered at home, a PACE center, a hospital or a long-term care facility -- seamlessly moving back and forth under the supervision of one interdisciplinary team for a fixed cost.   The model for PACE was developed 27 years ago in San Francisco's Chinatown/North Beach area by a community center called On Lok (Cantonese for ""peaceful, happy abode""). The On Lok approach was replicated elsewhere using foundation grants and gradually embraced by Congress, which eventually authorized all PACE programs as Medicare providers.  The formula is hard to quarrel with. According to several studies, PACE clients, while far more frail than the average Medicare recipient, cost taxpayers less money in government-funded medical care, have fewer and shorter hospital stays, rarely wind up in nursing homes (even though they must be eligible to enroll in one), and report satisfaction rates close to 100 percent.   Readers of this blog, physicians, researchers in geriatrics and gerontology, clients and family members -- all have urged that I visit a PACE center, and so recently I did.  The nation's largest PACE provider is the Comprehensive Care Management Corporation in the Bronx. What I found there is a model that bridges the customary divide between acute and chronic care, and assigns each client to an interdisciplinary team that coordinates care across different settings. The program pays for coverage as a H.M.O. would, with a fixed annual cost per patient rather than a fee-for-service set-up.    But unlike many H.M.O.'s, the program doesn't operate as a faceless bureaucracy serving as gatekeeper to all but primary care physicians, and granting and denying services or procedures. Rather, at 40-odd locations in 22 states, PACE means care by an interdisciplinary team that knows the patient and family, their histories, strengths, limitations and goals. Team members decide the care plan with each member, tweak it as things change, and rarely say 'no' to anything that will sustain quality of life.   PACE offers its members access to primary care physicians, specialists, home health aides, transportation, recreation and companionship at a day center, meals (at the center or delivered to home), medical assistance on call 24-hours-a-day -- and just about anything else that will make it possible for extremely frail and cognitively impaired elders to remain at home.   The breadth and flexibility of PACE's services were apparent during a daily team meeting in late December, on the eve of a snow storm. First the assembled doctors, nurses, social workers, rehabilitation and recreation specialists, transportation coordinators, clinic schedulers and office managers reviewed the overnight emergency calls. These had been answered by a real person who had assessed whether a trip to the emergency room was needed or the problem could be handled by phone or with a home visit, always the goal. One person hospitalized overnight because of seizures had already received a dawn visit from her regular PACE doctor, with reassurance that her home health aide was on standby for her return and that her missing coat had been located.  The team then discussed new clients and those needing changes in their care plan: a woman who felt well enough to come to the center five days a week and thus required a new transportation schedule; a hospitalized patient ready for discharge whom they hoped to keep to keep longer, since his wife needed a break from caregiving; a new member who'd asked for more fresh fruits and vegetables among the daily lunch choices.   Next came a review of everyone who had been expected that day at the center on Allerton Avenue -- one of seven run by C.C.M. in the New York metropolitan area -- but had not shown up yet. Some were out of town visiting relatives, others at outside medical appointments or under the weather. A few had been stranded by transportation glitches. Anyone unaccounted for -- and there were only a few -- would be called or visited immediately, especially with the storm bearing down.  All PACE members are ranked by priority. Level 1 means they can't be alone at home without an aide. Level 2 means they need someone to shop, organize medications or otherwise make a short home visit every day. And level 3 means they are either safe alone or have family or neighbors for back-up support. Since weather reports suggested the center might have only a skeleton staff the next day, arrangements were made to get aides, food, backup oxygen tanks and whatever was needed to each of 300 clients classified at levels 1 or 2. For level 3 clients, staff would double check that relatives and friends hadn't all decamped for the holidays.   Outside the meeting room, three staff physicians were seeing patients. On certain days, they are joined by a wound care expert, since pressure sores are an abiding problem for those who spend all their time in bed or in a wheelchair. Also available are two psychiatrists specializing in depression, anxiety and dementia-related agitation; an ophthalmologist and optometrist to treat the myriad of vision problems associated with age; and a podiatrist, because many older people cannot cut their own toenails and risk infection or diabetic complications if the job is not done regularly and carefully.   Other specialists, on contract from a local hospital, see patients in their own offices, with transportation and translation provided by PACE, as well as immediate consultation between the primary care doctor and the specialist.  In the recreation and dining areas, members are welcome for breakfast and lunch and sent home with dinner. At the Allerton Ave. center, located in an area with a large Latino population, someone reads newspapers aloud in Spanish every day, down to the horoscopes and the box scores.   Staff members take notice if anyone is making frequent trips to the bathroom, and a nurse is on hand to check for a urinary tract infection, another condition especially dangerous for the elderly. The center has handicapped-accessible showers for those who can't use the ones they have at home, as well as washing machines and dryers. Some clients manage but one visit a week; others come daily. All are provided free transport, with an aide if necessary, but also have the option of many of the same services at home.   All PACE members nationwide must be 55 or older and eligible under state regulations for nursing home placement, which generally means they require assistance or supervision with basic tasks like bathing, dressing, walking or getting from bed to a wheelchair. Medicare, which provides health coverage for all Americans over the age of 65, pays a share of the ""capitated"" annual free per member. Medicaid pays the remainder for those who qualify on grounds of low income.  Anyone otherwise eligible for PACE but not covered by Medicaid can make up the difference out-of-pocket, which in New York State would be around $3,500 a month -- a tidy sum but far less than the cost of home health aides, assisted living with the enhanced services people this frail would need, or placement in a skilled nursing facility. In other words, this excellent care is not limited to the indigent, as it is in many other pilot programs run by Medicaid.   Each PACE program must manage its funds wisely, lest the cost of services exceeds the fixed fees. That encourages preventive care that members might not receive otherwise. For instance, government reimbursement and most private insurance will not pay for ongoing physical therapy once a patient has ""plateaued,"" and so often treatment stops, which can lead to further loss of mobility. But since physical therapy is cheaper than repairing a broken hip or providing round-the-clock care for someone who is bed-bound, PACE does pay for ongoing physical therapy, an approach that is cost-effective to the taxpayer, according to several studies, and leads to better outcomes.   After a day at the PACE center, my only reservation is whether a middle-class person -- say, my mother -- would have given a program like this a chance or been put off by the race, ethnicity or cultural differences of the other clients. She was by no means a prejudiced woman, but the older she got the more her comfort level depended on being among people of similar background.   I was embarrassed to raise this question. But, PACE officials told me, my mother's resistance would not have been unusual or viewed as a sign of bad character. Shared experience matters at this time of life, and PACE centers tend to reflect the neighborhoods where they are located. My mother might have done well at C.C.M.'s Westchester County center, in White Plains, N.Y., or a center in Amityville on Long Island that is soon to open.   PACE centers around the country are listed on the Web site of the National PACE Association, along with program details. Further information is available through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. My thanks to all of you who told me to go take a look.

Belloli, who is 74, was born in Framingham, Mass., which is where she met her future husband, Joseph, when they were both toddlers.

Many of her friends from grade school never left Framingham, either, so after 60 years, she still sees a half dozen of them every six weeks.
