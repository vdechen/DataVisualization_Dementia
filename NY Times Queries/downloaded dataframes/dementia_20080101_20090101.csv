Sue Halpern finds out what scientists know about dementia.,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/books/review/Dunn-t.html,Sue Halpern finds out what scientists know about dementia.,"Behind all the good-natured joking about “senior moments” lies real frustration and fear. How empowering, then, that we can do something to ward off normal, age-related memory loss: exercise. No, it’s not as easy as popping a pill. But as Sue Halpern reports in “Can’t Remember What I Forgot,” even a few brisk walks per week can have a measurable effect. Exercise promotes the birth of new neurons in the very part of the hippocampus (a brain structure crucial to forming new memories) that begins to malfunction with age. Exercise also counters age-related shrinking of the prefrontal cortex, an area involved in concentration and working memory (as in remembering a phone number long enough to dial).",BR,23,The New York Times,"[{'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'articleInline', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2008/05/25/books/dunn-190.jpg', 'height': 265, 'width': 190, 'legacy': {}, 'subType': 'articleInline', 'crop_name': 'articleInline'}, {'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'thumbnail', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2008/05/25/books/dunn-75.jpg', 'height': 75, 'width': 75, 'legacy': {'thumbnail': 'images/2008/05/25/books/dunn-75.jpg', 'thumbnailwidth': 75, 'thumbnailheight': 75}, 'subType': 'thumbnail', 'crop_name': 'thumbStandard'}]","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Memory', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Books and Literature', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Medicine and Health', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': ""Alzheimer's Disease"", 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Dementia', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Aphasia', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Halpern, Sue', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}]",2008-05-25T04:00:00+0000,article,BookReview,Books,Book Review,Review,nyt://article/3863332c-e84d-5559-906c-122cee93f98f,913,nyt://article/3863332c-e84d-5559-906c-122cee93f98f,Partial Recall,,,Partial Recall,,,,By Kyla Dunn,"[{'firstname': 'Kyla', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Dunn', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,dementia

Becoming single in midlife through death or divorce dramatically increases risk for dementia in the older years.,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/01/blogs/01well-marriage471.html,Becoming single in midlife through death or divorce dramatically increases risk for dementia in the older years.,"(Photo: (Credit:Benjamin Sklar/Associated Press))   Whether you are single or divorced in midlife appears to influence your risk of developing Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia as you age.  It's long been known that social relationships can decrease the risk of developing dementia. In June, Harvard researchers reported how active socializing in old age could delay memory problems.   But most research on social relationships and dementia measures the social life of the very old. The newest study, presented at the 2008 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease in Chicago, focused on the effect relationships in midlife may have on long-term risk. It tracked 2,000 men and women in Finland beginning at the age of 50 and followed up with them 21 years later.   They found that people who were living with a spouse or a partner in midlife ran a 50 percent lower risk of developing dementia during their older years than people living alone. How long a person had been single and the reason they were single also affected risk. Living alone for your entire adult life doubled risk, but those who had been married and then divorced and remained single in midlife showed three times the risk.  Those at greatest risk of developing dementia were people who had lost their partner before middle age and then continued to live as a widow or widower. The study showed that these individuals had a six times greater chance of developing Alzheimer's than those who were married.  ""This suggests two influencing factors -- social and intellectual stimulation and trauma,"" said lead author Krister Håkansson, a psychology researcher at Växjö University and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. ""In practice, it shows how important it is to put resources into helping people who have undergone a crisis.""  Dr. Håkansson said future research will focus on whether risk is influenced by the quality of the relationship or whether someone always intended to live a single life or not.

Given Ms. Lyall's perspective, I asked her thoughts on the recent revelation that former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, like President Ronald Reagan before her, is losing her mind and her memories to a form of dementia. Here are her observations, with a link to the story that is striking a chord on both sides of the Atlantic. -- Jane Gross  (Photo: President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Mrs. Thatcher's daughter recently has been criticized for publicly discussing her mother's dementia. (Associated Press))   In Britain, it has long been an open secret that former prime minister Margaret Thatcher has been sliding into dementia. ""Open"" because old friends and political allies can all see the changes in the proud woman known as the Iron Lady, particularly since she suffered a series of mini-strokes in 2002 and withdrew from public speaking on her doctors' advice. And ""secret"" because no one has spoken publicly about it.   Until now. Last month her daughter, Carol Thatcher, revealed all to a newspaper, The Mail on Sunday. In an excerpt from her forthcoming memoir, ""A Swim-On Part in the Goldfish Bowl,"" Carol Thatcher not only announced that her mother, now 82, is suffering from dementia but offered excruciating evidence.   Sometimes Mrs. Thatcher forgets what she has eaten for breakfast, her daughter wrote. Once she conflated the Falklands War with the Bosnian conflict. Cruelly, she has had to be reminded repeatedly that her beloved husband, Denis, is dead. (He died in 2003.)  Carol Thatcher's heartbreak at seeing her formidable mother reduced to a confused old woman is all too familiar to anyone caring for a friend or relative suffering a similar fate. But Mrs. Thatcher is an iconic and larger-than-life figure -- ""far more than the sum of her parts,"" Vanessa Feltz wrote in the Daily Express -- and Britain is still a country where privacy, particularly in matters of health, is valued. Many people have reacted angrily to Carol Thatcher's disclosures.   In The Daily Telegraph, Andrew Pierce noted that Mrs. Thatcher's friends had purposely kept silent, in order to ""preserve the great lady's dignity and grace in a quiet, discreet way."" In The Daily Express, Anne Widdecombe, a Tory M.P., said, ""The only consolation, perhaps, is that Margaret Thatcher almost certainly does not know what her daughter has done."" And in The Sun, Kelvin MacKenzie raised the issue of who owns the reputation of a public figure like Mrs. Thatcher -- her family or the wider world?   ""My question is: why did Carol think it right to reveal her mother's plight, especially when none of her political friends had ever done so even in their political books?"" he asked. ""I can only conclude it was done for money. I hope she feels proud of herself."" And across the Atlantic, Ronald Reagan Jr. -- whose father publicly announced at age 82 that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease -- called Carol Thatcher's detailed account ""in monumentally bad taste and unnecessary.""   But the debate doesn't end there.   On the one hand, it does seem to violate a proud woman's privacy to describe the sad diminishment of her formidable powers, particularly when she doesn't seem capable -- as President Reagan was -- of making the disclosures herself. On the other hand, it makes her poignantly human. Many of our parents will, in the end, suffer what she is suffering; many of us will, too, when our turn comes.   So why the secrecy and shame? Many people who have written to the British papers and posted on various Web sites have made robust arguments for speaking openly about one of the great taboos of our time. As a friend of mine put it, ""If you refuse to talk about it, you're treating it as something shameful,"" once the common response to cancer.   My friend is acquainted with a 71-year-old woman whose mind is slipping. Her husband knows it; her acquaintances know it; she herself knows it on some level, despite her doctor's euphemistic diagnosis. She anxiously asks whether she is repeating things (she is) and frets that she is forgetting what she used to remember (she is).   But she refuses to confront the obvious, and her friends have all been forced to join this conspiracy of silence. This means there is a lot of speculating and gossiping about her condition. How bad is it? Can we bring it up with her husband? What plans is she making for the future? At the same time, there is no real chance to acknowledge the reality or commiserate with the family's pain.

Is this the future of care for the elderly?",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/blogs/16newoldage-when-med75.html,"Unable to accept new Medicare patients, a physician in Chicago resorts to a new kind of geriatric assessment. Is this the future of care for the elderly?","(Photo: Dr. Cheryl Woodson, a geriatrician in Chicago Heights, Ill., attends to patient Adeline Robinson, who is in her 90s. Dr. Woodson says she can no longer afford to accept new patients on Medicare. (Sally Ryan for The New York Times))    For Dr. Cheryl E. Woodson, geriatric medicine is a passion that doesn't pay the bills.   ""I love this. I just love this,'' she said one recent afternoon in her office in Chicago Heights, Ill. Dr. Woodson had just diagnosed early-stage dementia in a 73-year-old patient, recommending a hip replacement while the woman is still cognitively capable of rehabilitation, and then had consoled the woman's weeping daughter.   But Dr. Woodson can no longer afford to run her solo practice as she once did. She has stopped taking new patients over the age of 65, when Medicare kicks in, since reimbursement for their care is now ""40 cents on the dollar,'' she said, not enough to staff her office and pay the rent.   ""If I take new Medicare patients, I can't keep the door open,'' Dr. Woodson said. With Medicare paying less now then it did in 2001, she added, ""you can serve seniors or feed your children."" Not both.  Dr. Woodson's dilemma is shared by many internists and family practitioners, endangered specialists in a health care system that pays for procedures and tests but not for the time-consuming management of chronic conditions. ""We get paid to do things to people, not for people,'' Dr. Woodson is fond of saying.   This is especially true for the elderly, who are generally not good candidates for we-can-fix-it medicine. Instead, as they lose mobility, cognition and thus independence, they require lengthy office visits, close monitoring and supportive services. These days, it is difficult to find a new doctor for anyone over the age of 65, because they are so expensive to treat.   Dr. Woodson's solution to the cash crunch is to keep her existing elderly patients and to turn away new ones. At the same time, however, she has begun providing geriatric consultations, much like a cardiologist or orthopedist might. Each Wednesday afternoon, she does three such consultations, each at least an hour long, which produce what she calls a ""level-of-care prescription'' that the primary-care physician and family can implement on their own.   The goal of the assessment is to determine what's wrong with the elderly patient, whether it can be fixed and how to manage things if it can't be, which is often the case. Each appraisal details the patient's overall health status and involves a review of current medications, level of independence, mobility, behavior and memory.   From that assessment comes a recommendation of what services are needed, who can deliver them and where that is best accomplished: at home, in a retirement facility or in a nursing home. That determination is not based soley on a patient's condition, but also on how much hands-on care family members are willing and able to provide and how much hired help they can afford. Often the evaluation is followed by a family meeting, with Dr. Woodson as referee.   One recent Wednesday, I observed as Dr. Woodson performed two office assessments and convened a family meeting via conference call. It is not as satisfying as an all-geriatric practice, she told me, and some of the consultation patients wish they could stay. But a little geriatrics is better than none at all, and this approach could be the wave of the future.  The first assessment involved a 79-year-old woman with dementia so advanced she was unable to answer the doctor's questions or follow her instructions during a cognitive exam, rearranging the contents of her purse instead of drawing a clock with its hands at 11:10, as Dr. Woodson had gently requested. When asked to spell the word ""world"" both forward and backward, the patient declared, ""I really have to go now.''  The woman, who lives in a facility for those with Alzheimer's disease, was taking a cornucopia of medications likely to exacerbate her confusion and increase the odds of a serious fall. Dr. Woodson later suggested altering the regime. She also advised the woman's stepdaughters against any tests or procedures designed to prolong the patient's life rather than improve its quality. The patient's severe neck pain was likely the result of arthritis, Dr. Woodson said, and nothing could be done for it but pain medication and heat. So why subject her to a M.R.I.?   The second assessment involved a 73-year-old woman with subtle signs of dementia noticeable only to a professional or a close family member. She also was suffering from necrosis of the hip and rated the pain as 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. Dr. Woodson adjusted the length of the woman's cane, confirmed her daughter's fear that some recent erratic behavior was consistent with very early dementia, and urged hip surgery to relieve the pain while the patient could still follow the directions of a physical therapist.   The phone consultation involved an 87-year-old woman at an assisted living facility whose health was in steep decline. Now she needed services not included in her monthly rent: someone to dispense medication four times a day, help her into compression stockings each morning to reduce swelling in her legs, provide three treatments a day with a nebulizer to facilitate her breathing and accompany her to numerous doctors' appointments. At the moment, the woman's daughter, who had a job and family, was doing all of this and more.   One alternative, Dr. Woodson told the woman's son, was to hire private-duty health aides and a geriatric care manager to take some of the burden off his sister. The other was to move his mother to a nursing home, where a 24/7 staff would either do or arrange everything. The son was resistant to the first because of the expense and to the second because he preferred the beautiful setting at the assisted living facility to the hospital-like environment of a nursing home.   The call ended without a resolution. ""I'm not sure he understands there is no level of care between assisted living and a nursing home,'' Dr. Woodson said later. ""As his mother's condition worsens, they are going to need more and more services. One person can't handle this, and I think he's only giving only lip service to the amount of work his sister is doing.''  How I would have loved hearing this kind of medical advice when my mother's needs exceeded what an assisted living facility could deliver or when there was conflict between me and my brother. I was too ignorant to look for a geriatrician and in any event probably wouldn't have been able to find one, given the crisis of supply and demand. But even locating a plain-vanilla internist willing to take a new Medicare patient was an ordeal. Everyone we called said his practice was full. Finally, my brother's physician persuaded his sister, also a doctor, to see my mother. I don't know what we would have done otherwise.  Have any of you or your loved ones been turned away by physicians unwilling to take on new Medicare patients? Please share your stories -- and if you have any, solutions. The problem will only grow as those of us in our 60s outlive our current doctors or relocate and need to find new ones.

Maybe so. But that's because people are not allowed to die of old age -- at least, old age cannot be listed as the cause of death on the official documents, according to both the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization, repositories of the world's mortality statistics.   Neither should ""infirmity'' or ""senescence'' appear as a cause of death, according to the C.D.C. handbook on how properly to fill out a death certificate. Why? These words ""have little value for public health or medical research,"" the agency says. Plus, ""Age is recorded elsewhere on the [death] certificate.''   (Photo: A sample death certificate and instructional text from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ""Physicians' Handbook on Medical Certification of Death."" (Jonathan Corum/The New York Times))   Instead, every death must be attributed to a single disease, which is the immediate cause of death. A second disease may be cited as the intermediate cause, and a third as the underlying condition. Even in situations ""when a number of conditions or multiple organ/system failure resulted in death,'' the C.D.C. instructs that ""the physician, medical examiner or coroner should choose...a clear and distinct etiological sequence,'' a ""chain of morbid events.''  It sounds orderly, doesn't it? But 80- and 90-year-olds don't usually die of one thing. Little by little, the wheels fall off the bicycle. The first few times, you patch everything up. But it's never quite the same. Each setback is a little worse than the last. Bad stuff happens more often. Eventually, as with all machines, the human body simply wears out.   In his remarkable bestseller ""How We Die,"" Sherwin Nuland rails at the ""soulless summary'' of the death certificate. He finds it ridiculous and dishonest that ""government statisticians and the scientific clinicians insist that proper names must be applied to sluggish circulation and an antique heart.''   To the C.D.C., a cause of death might be cardiac arrest, precipitated by a gastric hemorrhage, which in turn was the result of an ulcer. Or something more challenging to decode: a rupture of the myocardium caused by acute myocardial infarction, caused by coronary artery thrombosis and underlying atherosclerotic coronary heart disease.   But being old isn't the same as having a heart attack. Frail, weak, bedridden old people don't get cured, ever. ""To call a natural process by the name of a disease is the first step in an attempt to cure it and thereby thwart it,'' Dr. Nuland writes.   Plus, the ""biomedical world view'' distorts what actually happens. Veins and arteries stiffen and narrow. Less blood flows to the brain. Neurons die. Bones get brittle. Tiny strokes leave big deficits. Infections have their way once the immune system is shot. Sometimes all of the above happen, usually at least three.   When a person dies, calling the cause heart disease or pneumonia or osteoporosis or vascular dementia is both arbitrary and beside the point. In fact, everything stops working because the time is up. ""The thing that peters out,'' Dr. Nuland writes, ""is nothing other than the life force.""  What would it mean to medical science, I wonder, if death certificates did not describe us all as dying of something that could have been treated, and perhaps was, but instead of something inevitable and universally shared? Can we really pursue new treatments for heart disease or diabetes without also directly addressing their most frequent cause: age itself? And what would it mean for public policy if the leading cause of death among the very old was ""wheels falling off bicycle""? Would long-term care, its costs and indignities, find a place on the national agenda?   Dr. Nuland describes the very old in death as ""shrunken,'' and I can attest to that. My mother was tiny and crumpled, the light gone from her eyes. She died of old age, no matter what the death certificate says.

(Photo: Kate Blumm/Brooklyn Botanic Garden))    A rare orchid the size of a Volkswagen Beetle is blooming for the second time ever at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, a blessed event that has spurred envy among the handful of orchid growers who will even try to grow a plant this big.  Considered ""The Queen of Orchidaceous Plants,"" and one of the world's largest orchids, this particular Grammatophyllum speciosum is 12 feet in diameter and weighs about 200 pounds. It last bloomed in 2003 and has four huge flower spikes, at least one of which should remain in bloom for the next week or two, said David Horak, curator of the garden's orchid collection.  Known as the tiger or leopard orchid, the plant is native to Malaysia, Sumatra and New Guinea, where it grows in the crotches of trees more than 100 feet in the air. Plants can weigh up to two tons.   ""There are all kinds of anecdotal stories about workers being killed trying to remove one from a tree,"" Mr. Horak said.  If it is rare in nature, this Gulliver of the garden world is even rarer in captivity, because very few people or institutions can afford to grow it.  Mr. Horak bought the plant 10 years ago for $75 at an auction from the widow of Don Richardson, who was the orchid grower for Greentree, the Whitney estate on Long Island. It now hangs in a 30-inch square basket, 15 feet in the air above a pond in the Robert W. Wilson Aquatic House, part of the Steinhardt Conservatory.   As plants go, it is fairly high-maintenance, he said. It is watered every sunny day, and fed two or three times a week.     The last time we potted it, it took five people and a rope and pulley to lower it into the current basket. They resent being repotted, and for some time after we repotted it, it kind of sulked. It didn't grow very well for a couple years.  In an August 2007 article in Orchids, the bulletin of the American Orchid Society, Erich E. Michel, the operations manager of the Hoosier Orchid Company in Indianapolis, describes trying to get a Grammatophyllum to bloom. In the essay, titled ""I Need to Grow a Giant Orchid"" (a need his wife as defined as ""childish competitive dementia""), he described trying to coax blooms from the plant, which he variously refers to as ""the beast"" and ""the monster.""   (Photo: The orchid is about 12 feet in diameter and weighs about 200 pounds. At least one flower spike should remain in bloom for a week or two. (Photo: Kate Blumm/Brooklyn Botanic Garden))   The plant's spiny rootlets, which dry and harden until they are thornlike, catch plant and animal litter from above and form ""a self-made composter"" that helps feed the plant.  ""These barbed roots were just one way the plant could hurt you,"" he writes, then describes how, after nine years of waiting, the growers decided to force the plant to bloom, by starving it. ""We were going to make it think it was going to die,"" he wrote.   He succeeded in 2004, and again in 2007, when the plant produced eight flower spikes. That year, he decided to move it to the Garfield Park Conservatory in Indianapolis, which required four people to hold the pot and three to hold the plant's stems.   The Brooklyn orchid's next feat will be to produce a seed capsule the size of a Nerf football, Mr. Horak said. It will have about two million dustlike seeds in it, which may be offered to a commercial firm or other institution that wants to try growing its own. The seeds are considered an aphrodisiac in some circles, Mr. Michel wrote.

"The Watergate investigation changed history and spawned thousands of journalism careers, but until Sunday Carl Bernstein had never met the secret source known as Deep Throat.",https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/blogs/20thecaucus-at-last-7531.html,"The Watergate investigation changed history and spawned thousands of journalism careers, but until Sunday Carl Bernstein had never met the secret source known as Deep Throat.","(Photo: Clockwise from right: Bob Woodward, Mark Felt, Carl Bernstein and John O'Connor, Mr. Felt's co-author on ""A G-Man's Life"" (Photo: Joan Felt)) Updated During all the months that Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward spent cracking the Watergate scandal, and in all the years since, Mr. Bernstein had never met the reporters' most famous source, the man known as Deep Throat.  Until now.  Last Sunday, 36 years after the two young Washington Post reporters began writing about a botched burglary at the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate building in Washington, both men paid a visit to Mark Felt, whom they had dubbed Deep Throat, at his Santa Rosa, Calif., home.  Mr. Felt was the No. 2 man at the F.B.I., with intimate knowledge of the White House and the re-election campaign of President Richard M. Nixon, when Mr. Woodward began consulting him about the un-spooling Watergate story.  Mr. Bernstein was never privy to those meetings, and for nearly four decades never met the man who guided them through the investigation that ultimately linked Mr. Nixon and his closest White House aides to the break-in and cover-up. Two years later, their work led to the threat of impeachment, forcing Mr. Nixon to resign.  But late Sunday afternoon, Mr. Woodward and Mr. Bernstein met with Mr. Felt at his home on -- wait for it -- Redford Place in Santa Rosa, 55 miles north of San Francisco.   Mr. Felt, 95, suffers from dementia, but Mr. Bernstein said during their visit he had moments of clarity. The man who told them the truth when so many others had obfuscated and lied ""was engaged,"" Mr. Woodward said.   The two journalists were heading to the bay area for a talk at the Lesher Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek. Mr. Woodward said that in the back of their minds was the thought that this would be an opportunity to swing by for a visit to Mr. Felt, who has been in failing health. Joan, his daughter and caregiver, had warned that in the last few months he had almost died, Mr. Woodward said. So, he said, he and Mr. Bernstein agreed to fly west a day early to finally introduce Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Felt.  The meeting, late Sunday in the family living room, included neighbors, family members and friends of the Felts. ""It was like a family reunion,"" Mr. Woodward said, ""a festive family gathering."" Guests sipped iced tea as a few friendly dogs meandered about, he said.   Mr. Felt wore a white shirt -– ""like a good FBI man,"" Mr. Woodward said -- and a red blazer, which was not so much like an FBI man. Ms. Felt has said that her father has memories of two people: J. Edgar Hoover and Mr. Woodward.   The two reporters revealed the meeting Monday night, at the Walnut Creek speaking event, and Mr. Bernstein described it as ""a remarkable afternoon.""   ""We were there to pay our respects and gratitude and we conveyed that,"" Mr. Bernstein said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ""It was heartfelt and was received that way.""   Both he and Mr. Woodward described Mr. Felt as having ""great dignity and grace"" including, Mr. Bernstein said, ""in his words.""  ""It was a personal visit, not a working visit,"" he said, ""and it closed the circle.""  Deep Throat's identity had been kept secret for decades, as part of Mr. Woodward's journalistic pledge to Mr. Felt, and it became the source of great speculation. It was not until June 2005 that the public learned his identity, and even then it was not Mr. Woodward who disclosed the information but Mr. Felt in an article in Vanity Fair.   The relationship was fraught with mystery, vividly captured in a book and a movie, ""All the President's Men,"" (Robert Redford played Mr. Woodward and Dustin Hoffman played Mr. Bernstein, with Hal Holbrook playing the shadowy Deep Throat). The book described Mr. Woodward planting a red flag in a flower pot on the window sill of his apartment to signal to his source that they needed to meet. Deep Throat signaled his desire to talk by circling page 20 on Mr. Woodward's New York Times. They rendezvoused at an underground garage.   In a phone interview Wednesday, Mr. Woodward recalled Mr. Felt's importance to the investigation.   ""He provided confirmation and guidance and directed us,"" Mr. Woodward said. ""Here he is in an important position in the FBI. What he conveyed was the magnitude of Watergate, the way Nixon operated and that there were lots of tentacles and that it went to the top and that it was a concerted effort of political espionage to beat the Democrats in '72. And they did.""  ""It gave us comfort that it was not just the people we were talking to at the mid-level and low-level -- we had dozens of sources -- it was somebody at the crossroads of the investigation.""   Despite hundreds of speculative stories about Deep Throat's identity Mr. Woodward said today, ""Like all secrets, sometimes we hide it in plain sight.""   Mr. Woodward said an article headlined, ""FBI Finds Nixon Aides Sabotaged Democrats,"" in the Washington Post on Oct. 10, 1972, gave a major clue about the source, but few Watergate sleuths noticed. The hint was buried in the lead:  ""FBI agents have established that the Watergate bugging incident stemmed from a massive campaign of political spying and sabotage conducted on behalf of President Nixon's re-election and directed by officials of the White House and the Committee for the Re-election of the President…""    ",,,The New York Times,[],[],2008-11-20T17:05:33+0000,article,None,Blogs,,Web Log,nyt://article/f10ca6c2-567c-5043-bb8b-4141f8e51f07,925,nyt://article/f10ca6c2-567c-5043-bb8b-4141f8e51f07,"At Last, Bernstein Meets Deep Throat",The Caucus,,"At Last, Bernstein Meets Deep Throat",,,,By CAROL POGASH,"[{'firstname': 'Carol', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'POGASH', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,dementia
Workplace accommodations modeled on child care do not always benefit employees caring for aging parents.,https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/blogs/28newoldage-where-th83.html,Workplace accommodations modeled on child care do not always benefit employees caring for aging parents.,"Since the late 1960s and early 1970s, when working women made child care benefits a key part of the feminist agenda, it has become routine for companies to provide maternity leaves, job sharing and pre-tax accounts to pay for child care. These days, the accommodations offered to those of us caring for elderly parents often are modeled on these kinds of child care benefits. But the so-called ""mommy track"" and ""daughter track"" are more dissimilar than similar, and the child care paradigm does not always work to benefit adult caregivers.   For instance, most pregnant workers know when they will take maternity leave and for how long. But someone responsible for an aged parent faces an unpredictable series of crises. When the unexpected happens, the caregiver must use some of the time off granted under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act or depend on the good will of a supervisor.  Or take flexible spending accounts, which permit the use of pre-tax dollars for dependent care. I.R.S. regulations require that the dependent receive full financial support and live with the employee. That is generally the case with children, but rarely with elderly parents.   Perhaps it's no surprise, then, that corporate America is losing billions of dollars because of the soaring number of employees whose responsibilities for elderly parents result in absenteeism, lost productivity, premature retirement, stress-related health problems and other consequences of attending to unpredictable crises during working hours.   These costs have been calculated by the MetLife Mature Market Institute, along with the National Alliance for Caregiving, and the bad news predictably is getting worse as the population ages. In 1997, overall costs to employers ranged from $11.5 billion to $29 billion a year, depending on how many hours a week of hands-on care employees were providing. By 2006, both numbers had jumped by more than $4 billion a year; costs ranged from $17.1 billion to $33.6 billion and are still rising.  Here are some examples of ways that employers are impacted when workers are torn between jobs and caregiving, and as a result reduce their hours, retire early, or suffer both mentally and physically from the stress.   * The cost of replacing experienced employees who quit: $6.6 billion in 2006, up from $4.9 billion in 1997.  * Workday interruptions: $6.3 billion in 2006, up from $3.7 billion in 1997.  * Absenteeism: $2.5 billion in 2009, up from $885 million in 1997.   (Using from a simple online tool, employers can estimate how much money they are losing based on the size of a business, the average hourly wage and the number of employees with caregiving responsibilities.)   Reducing those costs will require companies to rethink many of the options they offer to employees. One benefit with real utility for caregivers is back-up care, usually provided by a company under contract with an employer. Any time an employee has a temporary need for child care or eldercare -- say, a sick babysitter or a home health aide who fails to show up -- he or she can get a temporary replacement, by the next morning, by making one phone call. The cost of the replacement care generally is subsidized by the employer.  One of the nation's leading providers of back-up care is the Work Options Group , based in Superior, Colo., whose clients include Microsoft, Verizon Wireless, Princeton University and Prudential Financial. This year, Work Options will serve 600,000 employees, a 30 percent increase in just two years. But according to C.E.O. Cindy Carrillo, 90 percent of the employees using the service are mothers (and some fathers), rather than daughters (and some sons).  I asked Ms. Carrillo why this was so, given the number of employees nationwide with responsibility for aging parents. (Estimates range from 16 to 20 million.) On explanation, she said, is the average age of employees at the companies she works with: 35 to 37 years old at high-tech or telecommunications concerns, and 45 to 47 years old in more old-line businesses. In either case, she said, they are more likely to have young children than dependent parents.   But numbers tell only a small part of the story. Those on the mommy track, she added, are far more comfortable seeking help from their human resource departments and far more likely, now as in the past, to press for what they need if they're not getting it. And few companies want to be seen as politically incorrect regarding child care.   By contrast, Ms. Carrillo said, those caring for parents (as she is) tend to hold their situations together with ""rubber bands and bubble gum'' and keep their problems to themselves -- knowing from experience that some bosses and colleagues avert their eyes or change the subject when talk turns to incontinence or dementia.   Ms. Carrillo noted, too, that few of us plan in advance for the time and money we may have to spend on eldercare, arguably because we don't want to think about it and are hoping it will never come up. Compare that to the elaborate preparation for the arrival of a new baby, Ms. Carrillo said, including child care arrangements and college savings accounts. Denial, then, affects how workers use these benefits even when they are offered.   ""We close one eye, look the other way, handle one hurdle at a time and don't realize how much trouble we're in until it accelerates,'' Ms. Carrillo said.  This mindset may account for the absence of activism among caregivers of the elderly, who have not made their voices heard as working mothers did decades ago.   ""Nobody wants to think about it beforehand,'' Ms. Carrillo said. ""When you're in the throes of it you don't have time. And when you're done, you don't want to go back there again.''

"Dr. Cheryl Woodson, an experienced geriatrician, offers some advice on navigating the caregiving maze.",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/blogs/20newoldage-10-thing76.html,"Dr. Cheryl Woodson, an experienced geriatrician, offers some advice on navigating the caregiving maze.","Dr. Cheryl Woodson, you may recall from last week's post, is a seasoned geriatrician in Chicago Heights, Ill., who has found that she can no longer afford to accept new Medicare patients.   She is also a blunt and funny woman who liberally dispenses wisdom to her elderly patients and their adult children, and herself a daughter who cared for her own mother with Alzheimer's disease for a decade. Here's some of Dr. Woodson's advice on navigating the caregiving maze, which I culled both from her book, ""To Survive Caregiving,"" and from observing her during a recent day-long visit to her office.   (Photo: Dr. Cheryl Woodson, geriatrician and author of ""To Survive Caregiving."" (Sally Ryan for The New York Times))   1. Assisted living, a popular solution for elderly people who cannot live independently, is a ""myth,"" Dr. Woodson said, ""a place for people who don't exist."" Families often believe these facilities will meet all of their loved ones' needs, enabling caregivers to focus on jobs and family, only to find this isn't the case. Before long, the elderly resident will require more than ""meals you don't have to cook, grass you don't have to cut and socialization,'' Dr. Woodson said. At that point the elderly resident is in trouble, since assisted living facilities are not permitted by law to provide medical care and consider it to be the family's responsibility.   2. Squaring a family's expectations with those legal limits would require a thorough, first-hand assessment of the elderly person's physical and cognitive health before admission to an assisted living facility. That rarely happens. New residents are admitted based on a report from their current physicians, who may not be qualified to diagnose the early signs of dementia and impending immobility or may sugarcoat the situation in order to help a desperate family. ""They just need a little help,'' the usual rationale for accepting elderly prospects into assisted living, is ridiculous on its face, Dr. Woodson said. ""If they just needed a little help, they'd still be in the community.""   3. Instead, without verifying the physician's report or the family's representations, these facilities may admit residents who already need help with simple tasks like dressing or eating, or will in the very near future, and then charge extra for these services. Some do this to fill empty beds; others give residency a shot as a kindness to desperate families, Dr. Woodson said. But when the resident declines, as all of them will unless they die suddenly, more and more a la carte services mean a bigger and bigger monthly bill, or more and more work for family members who expected the opposite.  4. Coordinating all the services that the assisted living facility doesn't provide generally falls to one sibling, Dr. Woodson noted, who then becomes overwhelmed, sacrificing more than should be expected. The solution is hiring a geriatric care manager -- ""They should be called rent-a-daughters,'' Dr. Woodson said -- adding further to the expense, until the resident and family can no longer afford this kind of accommodation and are forced to consider a nursing home.  5. Most families balk at the prospect of transferring an aging parent to a nursing home because they like the aesthetics of assisted living -- the carpeted floors, overstuffed chairs and crystal chandeliers. But without round-the-clock care, many residents are ""as alone at night as if they were in their own homes,'' Dr. Woodson said. Other families are unwilling to break a promise to Mom or Dad never to put them in a nursing home. The spirit of that promise -- to give a parent the best possible care -- is what matters, Dr. Woodson said, ""and sometimes that means not doing it yourself.'' An aging parent's condition may eventually require three shifts of nurses and aides, not a family member trying to take care of everything 24/7.  6. The doctors who see residents at assisted living facilities are essentially freelancers, not employees, since their fees are paid by Medicare and they also may maintain private practices. So rather than hang around the facility expecting them to answer your questions on the fly, Dr. Woodson suggested calling and arranging to see them ""by appointment, not by ambush.'' This consultation will not be covered by Medicare unless it coincides with a medical procedure for the resident. Still, it is essential in order to stay on top of an elderly person's medications, some of which may be unnecessary and even dangerous, and to make decisions about which medical care improves the quality of life and which is pointless and wasteful.  7. If a parent lives in an assisted living facility, families should closely monitor the monthly pharmacy bill, less for cost than for content. Is Xanax being prescribed for anxiety? There are numerous other remedies available without the potentially dangerous side effects. What about muscle relaxants for arthritic pain? They increase confusion in the elderly and add to the risk of falls; instead, ask for pain medication and/or a heating pad. If the assisted living facility offers to have prescriptions filled and delivered by a local pharmacy -- a huge convenience for family members -- be sure it's a pharmacy that insists upon periodic blood work or other tests for drugs that are supposed to be closely monitored.  8. The goal of medical care for the elderly, in Dr. Woodson's view and the view of every geriatrician I've ever interviewed, is to make day-to-day life more comfortable, not to cure illness or extend longevity. Examples? A joint replacement to relieve pain and improve mobility makes sense only if the patient has the cognitive ability to complete physical therapy. Otherwise, he or she will never walk again and would be better off avoiding surgery and simply being kept comfortable. Similarly, anyone who would refuse cancer treatment because of advanced age probably doesn't need a mammogram, Pap smear or colonoscopy. ""Why draw a map to someplace we know we're not going?'' Dr. Woodson asked.  9. Apply similar standards to immunizations and vaccinations. If someone is so ill or disabled that death would be welcome, refuse the vaccine for pneumonia, long known as ""the old person's friend.'' But never say no to the shingles vaccine, which can prevent an excruciating rash. ""Even if someone was only going to live five more minutes, that's the one thing I'd suggest,'' Dr. Woodson says. ""It's a quality-of-life issue.''  10. Do not assume that the presenting symptom of Alzheimer's disease will be forgetting words, losing things or other obvious examples of short-term memory loss. Often the first thing a family member will notice is an empty checking account, Dr. Woodson said, because a normally cautious and frugal person has been tricked by a get-rich-quick scheme or other scam. And like missing money, look out for pills missing from those seven-day dispensers that help people with multiple medications keep track of what they're taking and when. Family members may find the dispensers empty and worry about overdose, Dr. Woodson noted, but often the missing pills will turn up under couch cushions or scattered elsewhere around the house. Take this as a cue that it may be time for a cognitive assessment.

Advice on end-of-life care that could have eased my mother’s last days.,https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/15/blogs/15newoldage-what-an-125.html,Advice on end-of-life care that could have eased my mother’s last days.,"(Photo: Jane Gross's mother, Estelle Gross, at a nursing home in Riverdale, N.Y., in 2002.)   If only I'd had the 800 number for Compassion & Choices in the last difficult months of my mother's life. She was paralyzed, incontinent and unable to speak. I watched the light leave her eyes and her body crumple like a rag doll's, and I knew that one day soon she would say, ""Enough.''   During this period, my mother and I talked and talked and talked about her end-of-life choices, as we had for many years. A decade earlier the conversation had seemed totally academic, even a bit weird. But now we were both grateful that this was familiar territory. At regular family meetings at the nursing home where she lived, the social workers, nurses and doctors joined what had been our private dialog. Our willingness to look my mother's certain death squarely in the eye, they said, was both unusual in families and beneficial to her quality of life.   Despite my mother's helplessness and misery those last months, she wasn't dying of anything. She had a garden-variety set of ailments for an 87-year-old woman: high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, an inner-ear disturbance. A series of imperceptible strokes, known as T.I.A.'s, had left her body useless. But they didn't necessarily portend a deadly event. She'd dodged the bullets of cancer, serious heart or pulmonary disease, and dementia. It is not uncommon, having lived past 85, to keep on living for a very long time -- ""healthy'' in the narrow sense of the word, but increasingly incapacitated. That, alas, was my mother's fate.   She often longed for the oblivion of Alzheimer's disease. But her sharp mind -- she never skipped a beat -- entitled her to organize her own death, within legal limits, which she did by deciding to stop food and hydration. We had discussed and researched this option, and we had read enough to be reasonably confident this manner of dying was not a frightful ordeal but rather a gentle death. We trusted that an enlightened nursing home like the one she was in wouldn't force her to eat and drink. They had readily accepted earlier decisions to forgo diagnostic tests or hospitalizations, and later antibiotics for pneumonia.   Our study of what is known as V.S.E.D., or ""voluntarily stopping eating and drinking,"" was impressive for amateurs, if I do say so myself. My mother had a pretty good death, on her own terms, and we had the nursing home's full support. I'm proud and grateful to have been able to advocate for her and to have been by her side. That said, there were several rough patches. And after recently meeting Judy Schwarz, the patient support coordinator for Compassion & Choices in New York, I now can see we'd have had an easier time of it had she been along for the ride.   What follows are a few of the bumps in the road that I bet would have been smoothed with her expert guidance.   * Medical professionals can only guess how long it takes to die of dehydration. (Merely refusing food is a bad idea, as many people who have gone on long hunger strikes can surely attest.) My mother's nurses and doctors said she'd likely last four, five, six days -- a week at most. With that in mind, I settled into a recliner in her room with books, music, snacks and a few changes of clothes, and I intended to stay by her side, as promised, for the duration.   In fact, she lived for 13 days, alert and communicative for about a week and manifesting none of the signs of impending death until the last 36 to 48 hours. Why the discrepancy? People in my mother's robust condition rarely make this choice. It is typically how people die in the end stages of cancer or Alzheimer's disease, following a progressive loss of interest or ability to eat and drink -- not an abrupt dinner-yesterday-but-no-breakfast-today-thank-you-very-much announcement. I don't know if my mother experienced time as I did, but to me it felt interminable. To my shame, I did a lot of clock-watching. Eventually I went home at night, leaving behind a private-duty aide.   I doubt I'd have twitched with impatience, just wanting for it to be over, had I known that the average dying time is two to three weeks, as the scientific literature says. Judy Schwarz would have told me that. I think the days would have been more peaceful and contemplative had I not been surprised by how long it took.   * Several of my mother's caregivers, both nurses and aides, had moral or religious reservations about her decision. To their credit, they didn't just switch to the other side of the floor. They came to me, in tears, to say this was something their consciences would not permit. They visited her several times a day, but delegated the hands-on responsibilities to others. At the time, I admired their honesty and felt their hurt and love, but I wondered if this behavior was appropriate. Shouldn't they be able to leave their personal convictions at home?   The answer, I now know, is that they followed the canons of their profession perfectly: no health professional is required to participate if that violates a personal belief system. What they are required to do is ensure a smooth hand-off to someone equally qualified.   * During and after my mother's death, I was often stung by the implied or expressed judgments of friends, colleagues and even strangers after I wrote about the experience. ""You let your mother do that?,'' I was frequently asked, with the word ""let'' heavy with opprobrium. My answer, generally, was that it wasn't up to me. She was mentally competent and entitled to do as she pleased. My job as her daughter was to be supportive. Left unsaid, once I'd experienced the first episodes of shock and disapproval, was that I totally agreed with her. Expecting the reaction of others would have helped.   * Once my mother began her fast, the nursing home offered two ways to ensure her comfort. The regular staff could stay in place, keeping her mouth from getting too dry and administering sedatives as needed under the supervision of a palliative care physician. Or a team of hospice professionals, part of what was then a new collaboration with the nursing home, could take their places at the bedside. I opted for the familiar. My mother didn't warm easily to strangers, and I thought she would need the comfort of people she knew well.   A counselor like Ms. Schwarz would have told me that the regulars might ask to be taken off the case, which might have changed my mind. She also would have told me that a hospice team likely would medicate my mother more aggressively, given their training in cutting-edge comfort care. Even if I'd stuck to my plan and later wished I'd chosen hospice, Ms. Schwarz would have suggested a change of course. It never occurred to me that was possible. I was too tired to think straight.  * I have always assumed that what my mother chose to do herself, I could have insisted upon for her, as her health care proxy. In other words, if she were no longer ""decisionally capable,'' though not on the brink of death, I could have told the staff to stop spooning food into her mouth or bringing the straw to her lips, and they would have listened to me as her surrogate. Ms. Schwarz would have told me this isn't so. Other end-of-life experts are less certain but know of no test cases. From that I conclude that V.S.E.D. should be considered a viable option only for cognitively intact men and women. Maybe that's why it's called ""voluntarily stopping eating and drinking.''

More on what geriatric care managers can do for caregiving families.,https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/blogs/09newoldage-reading-71.html,More on what geriatric care managers can do for caregiving families.,"Geriatric care manager Pat Mulvey answers more questions about how professionals like herself interact with family caregivers. -- Jane Gross   Caregivers are told all the time that they must look after themselves. But in my experience knowing what you should do doesn't mean you can actually do it. How do you carve out time for yourself if you have a job and/or children? And how can you use that time most restoratively?   Self-care means different things to different people. I've found that to take care of oneself doesn't necessarily mean a day at a spa -- although that would be nice! Some days it means to remember to inhale and exhale. Sometimes just listening to soft music while lying on your bed and concentrating on your breath can be restorative. Self-care can mean getting a good night's sleep, eating right, remembering to laugh at something (anything!) during the day. Sometimes M&M's help! A short walk outside, maybe around the block, at least gives a caregiver a change of scenery, some fresh air and the empowered feeling that you are not a hostage to caring for your loved one.  If you do have help in caring for your loved one, let them do what they are hired to do! Use that time to go to the library to sit quietly; go for lunch with a friend, or go shopping. One of my friends uses the time she has help in caring for her mother to go to a department store and try on fancy dresses.   It's also very helpful to consider adult cay care programs. There are many day centers where transportation is provided, meals and snacks are available, and the elder has the opportunity to socialize with others. There are medical model day centers and social day centers. A care manager can help you to identify what might be best and how to pay for it. There are centers that operate during the day, and centers that operate in the evening and overnight hours. The latter can be especially helpful when the elder's disease process has altered his or her internal clock.  Respite is another wonderful option for caregivers. Skilled nursing facilities and hospitals may have beds set aside for this. The elder can stay at the facility for a period of time and be cared for 24 hours per day. This gives family members an opportunity to take a vacation, have some down time and regroup. Your care manager can help explain and identify where these centers are in your community.   No criticism intended, but this is all pretty standard advice both from friends and professionals. But often caregivers can't or won't peel themselves away. When an adult child, especially a daughter, refuses to delegate anything and runs herself into the ground, what is going on emotionally or within the family that makes it impossible for her to back off a little?   This is an area where family history plays a huge part in how we respond to the caregiving role. If part of the family lore or story is that grandmother took care of eight children under the age of 7 while also taking care of both her aging parents and working as a seamstress while her husband worked in the mines -- that becomes ingrained in us each time the story is repeated, and the story takes on different meanings in each of the listeners, like the childhood game of telephone.  Geriatric care managers usually come into the story in the last chapters. These are longstanding relationships between mother and daughter, mother and son, father and daughter or son, and we have just picked up the book and are reading it backwards. A lifetime of experiences have occurred, and it's highly unlikely we'll know the depth and intricacies of these relationships in the time we get to work with the family.  But we strive to build a safe, trusting relationship with the caregivers. We listen carefully to fully assess what they are saying -- and as importantly, what they are not saying -- to identify the history behind the choices that are being made. Geriatric care managers are skilled at being able to identify driving forces that even the child is not conscious of. Sometimes understanding why we're behaving the way we are can help the caregiver look at the situation differently. In working with both the elder and the caregiver, we can weave the story together and provide the interpretation of the tale in a way that will help the family deal with the here and now.  And we shouldn't forget about the spouse as caregiver. Very often the aging caregiver spouse does not want to accept help or suggestions from his or her children, which means the children are in a more difficult position as they are trying to protect and care for both parents. Many times, the spouse caregiver is more open to suggestions from an outsider than they are from their own children.   Can you compare the caregiving experience and the role of a geriatric case manager when the elderly person is suffering from physical frailty versus a dementing illness? Many of us assume that nothing is harder than being responsible for someone with AIzheimer's. Is this true, or are the frail equally hard but in different ways?  I think caring for a loved one with either physical frailty or a dementia is very difficult, because it forces us to think about our own mortality. On the one hand, caring for one who is frail to the point where they need assistance with some or all of their activities of daily living -- everything from feeding themselves to dressing, toileting and bathing -- is very hard for family members. It prompts enormous emotional responses when you are feeding your parent who used to feed you, or bathing and doing other personal care for a loved one.  On the other hand, watching a parent and loved one loose his or her memory and identity is frustrating and difficult. When the loved one looks the same yet can't remember who you are, it's difficult to grapple with. When they ask the same question over and over again, it's easy to lose your temper, to think they have some control over the situation or they are just doing this to annoy you. Neither could be further from the truth, yet it's difficult to understand that the part of the brain that stores and retrieves this information is damaged and the loved one is unable to even be aware of it. It's hard to understand that although Dad can still do the crossword puzzle, he can't remember your name.  Tell us the main challenges siblings face in collaborating in a parent's care. Is the division of labor ever equal? What happens when one can afford to help out financially and the others can't? Or when one is capable and responsible and the others are not? I suspect gender and proximity are the key factors in who winds up the child-in-charge, not necessarily closeness to the parent. But what role does closeness play?   In my family, for instance, my mother and brother were soul mates, which I think made it much easier for her to talk about hard end-of-life stuff with me. Our distance, ironically, seemed an advantage. And what can you tell us about sibling conflict near the end of life? What if one child has the proxy and the other disagrees with decisions being made? Do you do what you think Mom or Dad would want at the expense of a lifelong sibling relationship?   It's so hard to generalize, because each family has its own dynamics. Geriatric care managers usually see that it is a daughter or daughter-in-law who is the primary caregiver, whether they live nearby or at a distance. And it depends on which sibling or family member you ask if the division of labor is ever equal.  Someone often feels they are doing more than the others. This also goes back to the history within the family, the mom-always-liked-you-best childhood jealousies that get triggered. How a family system has functioned in the past is indicative of how it will function at this tough time. A family meeting is imperative.  Many times, the children all live a long distance from the parents. In this case, we identify what needs to be done and the care manager will arrange to do it or have it done by a para-professional. If the children are able to and want to divide the care, we schedule a meeting with all the siblings to review the tasks that need to be addressed.   We get the children to look at what support each one of them can deliver according to their strengths and resources, and then we offer suggestions. While daughter number three might be the best to do the cooking and the shopping, the fact that she lives four hours away removes that option on a regular basis. Perhaps she can come monthly, do shopping and prepare some meals to freeze. Having a third party work with the children to develop the task list and the responsibility list and to keep the delegation of tasks on track is enormously beneficial.  Once we've hashed out the responsibilities, the tasks and the time schedule for them to be done, we write it all up in different formats. One is a list of the tasks by individual: Mary has five things to do, Sally has four but one will consume more time or resources. Bill has seven things to do on a regular basis, but he lives with Mom and this works best. We spend significant time on this aspect of a family meeting. I try to get all the issues out on the table so they can be talked about as a group with an independent ""referee.""  We also write it up as a calendar, so that all can see exactly what is expected every day for a month. That helps everyone to plan their other responsibilities around the caregiving tasks. If a change to the schedule or calendar needs to be made, the individual lets the care manager know and we negotiate with the others to meet the change. We can sometimes avoid old jealousies by being the clearinghouse and the keeper of the calendar.  In our family meetings, we counsel the family about issues that may come up, end-of-life decisions that may not be agreed by all, and who has the actual decision-making authority. We are the independent third party that each can vent to, and we help the family come as close to consensus as possible. Parents have individual relationships with each of their children when the children become adults. While it's impossible to identify why certain choices are made by the parent, by counseling the children individually and in a group, we hope to be able to lead them into acceptance of the choices and to help them to work together.

In advance of the vote, a number of former Marxist Parisian intellectuals like André Glucksmann announced their intention of voting for Sarkozy and against the rather vapid and temperamental quasi-spousal Socialist party team of Ségolène Royal and her significant other, François Hollande. And then, once the victory of Sarkozy had been assured — probably rather more by the votes of former rightists than former leftists — the new president offered some plum jobs to prominent Socialists like Bernard Kouchner, the ex-Communist and cofounder of the campaigning internationalist outfit Doctors Without Borders, who is now foreign minister, before himself proceeding to give new meaning to the term “husband and wife team” by marrying the former supermodel Carla Bruni in the Élysée Palace itself.
