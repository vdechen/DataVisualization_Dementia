"SILBERSTEIN-Sylvia, philanthropist, talented artist, and dedicated wife, mother, grandmother and friend, passed away Thursday, Dec. 17, 1998. Born in Hammond, Indiana on December 2, 1915, to Samuel & Jennie Kleinberg Levin, Sylvia was an alumni of Indiana University where she met her husband and fellow alumni William Silberstein. They subsequently married in 1937, and lived in Hammond until 1950. She and her family moved to Scarsdale in 1950 and to Rye, New York in 1968. Sylvia will be most remembered for her great sense of humor, buoyant spirit and constant smile. Her charm was contagious and she was adored by her many friends. Sylvia was noted for her culinary expertise, her love of classical music, the theater, tennis & was often consulted for her vast knowledge of travel due to her extensive world travel. Sylvia was a longstanding member of the Quaker Ridge Golf Club since 1955. She possessed sound business acumen and helped her husband found Sealectro Corporation in Mamaroneck, New York. She was also very active in the creation of various philanthropic programs. In 1984, Sylvia and her husband established the first fully endowed athletic scholarship at Indiana University and thereafter two additonal endowed athletic scholarships. Their other philanthropic endeavors include the William & Sylvia Silberstein Aging and Dementia Research Center at New York University Medical Center, the William & Sylvia Silberstein Cardiac Center at White Plains Hospital Center, and most recently, the William and Sylvia Silberstein Pavilion at White Plains Hospital Center. Sylvia supported many other charities including Cystic Fibrosis and U.J.A. amongst others. Her generous philosophy was apparent during World War II when she was President of Hammond, Indiana chapter of B'nai B'rith and she established a welcoming committee for all servicemen's trains providing food and other nourishment to them. Sylvia is survived by her husand, William of Rye, New York, her daughter Betsy Levinson of Stamford, Connecticut; her son Bruce and his wife, Carolyn, of New York City; her son, Sigmund of Boca Raton, Florida, and six loving grandchildren, Beth, Lori and Debra, Jill, Michael and Matthew; and a sister, Arlene Pascal of Highland Park, Illinois. Contributions in her memory may be made to the Silberstein Cardiac Center at White Plains Hospital Center, or The Silberstein Aging and Dementia Center at New York University Medical Center. A service will be held at 12:00 Noon on Friday, December 18th, at the Congregation Emanu-el, 2125 Westchester Avenue East, Rye, New York.     The faculty and staff of New York University School of Medicine offer our deepest condolences to the family of Sylvia Silberstein, philanthropist, talented artist, and dedicated wife, mother and grandmother. She and her husband, William Silberstein, have been long-term, major benefactors of NYU School of Medicine and their generosity has extended to many other institutions.

With his manic, caffeinated prose, his bravura showmanship and his merciless, sociological eye, he has given us a wonderfully entertaining gallery of madmen, hustlers, obsessives and dupes, and he has also opened his own distinctively surreal window on the dark side of the American Dream. A man who believes he's a killer bee, a circus performer who ties himself to the wing of an airplane, a primatologist who falls in love with one of her chimpanzees, a press agent who wants to upgrade the public image of the Ayatollah -- these are just a few of the zany, cartoon figures who populate Mr. Boyle's fiction.

" Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.    Opera    IL TROVATORE, Metropolitan Opera. The Met's production of ''Il Trovatore'' offers a rare glimpse of a mountain Gypsy hideaway surrounded by enormous ebony pillars and highly polished steps from which a campfire sprouts, and in past seasons the Met has sent some dreadfully uneven casts through this monstrosity. In the current run, the casting is fairly well balanced: Dolora Zajick gives Azucena unusual depth (even if she stints on the character's dementia), and June Anderson is in generally good voice as Leonora. As Manrico, Richard Margison tempers heroics with vulnerability, and Juan Pons brings a touch of humanity to the Count. Simone Young conducts. Tomorrow at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000.
