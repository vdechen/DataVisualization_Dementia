By morning, this wretched, miserly recluse has been transformed into the season's icon of exuberant celebration. This is, of course, the story of Ebenezer Scrooge -- the way Charles Dickens wrote it in his novella ""A Christmas Carol."" But there's another way to tell this familiar tale: an elderly man with no known medical problems has a sudden change in mental status characterized by confusion and vivid hallucinations involving friends and relatives, which leaves him in a state of trembling mania and uncharacteristic euphoria. This also describes Ebenezer Scrooge -- but as a doctor might see him. What caused these extraordinary symptoms? a doctor might ask.

They banter affectionately about golf, about the husband's past career as a local politician, about the children who have long since grown up. In the second act, set 54 years earlier, we see the doubts and joys of the newly married couple, negotiating around their insecurities as they banter affectionately about golf, about the husband's hopes for a career as a local politician, about the first child of the marriage (for she is newly pregnant).

"A city employee was arrested yesterday on charges of grand larceny, accused of stealing about $116,000 from a special education program, officials said. The employee, Sandra McMikle, who has worked for the Department of Education for about 25 years, was assigned to process reimbursement claims for transportation and other supplemental education services. From 2001 to this year, she submitted more than 40 fraudulent claims for services to a fictitious child, investigators said. The claims identified Ms. McMikle’s mother, who suffers from Alzheimer’s disease, as the person to be reimbursed for expenses on behalf of the fictitious child, investigators said. Ms. McMikle told investigators that she had “tried it once to see if it would work,” then began submitting claims regularly, a report said. The city paid the claims until January, when Ms. McMikle’s colleagues became suspicious of awkward wording and obsolete case numbers in the documents, the report said.

"BASTIEN--James William. A loving husband and father, and a passionate piano pedagogue and musician, passed away on December 7, 2005, in La Jolla, California. During his long career, Jim became internationally known through his contributions to piano teaching, composing, writing, adjudication, and performing. With more than 300 publications to his credit, the Bastien name has become synonymous with innovative piano pedagogy. Jim was born in Bellingham, Washington, on April 10, 1934. His father, Clarence, was musical and played the violin. His mother, Dorothy, was a writer and a high school Latin and journalism instructor. After living in Seattle and Florida, the family moved to Portland, Oregon, where Jim began his piano studies with Frances Mulkey North. Subsequently, Jim studied with the late Ariel Rubstein, the late Louis Artau, and the late Gyorgy Sandor. Jim received his undergraduate and Master's degrees from Southern Methodist University. He was a former member of the faculties of Notre Dame University, Tulane University, Loyola University (New Orleans), and the summer faculties of Tanglewood and the National Music Camp at Interlochen, Michigan. Jim met his wife Jane Smisor in New Orleans in 1960. They performed as the duo-piano team, Smisor and Bastien. In addition, Jim was a Columbia Artist accompanist whose collaborative career included appearances with Richard Tucker and John Alexander. During this time Jim and Jane started writing music to address the needs of their students. This was the beginning of the Bastien piano books that have inspired so many piano students and teachers. The Bastien piano books have been published worldwide by the Neil A. Kjos Music Company since 1963 and are now translated into 14 languages. In 1999, The Music Teachers National Association presented Jim and Jane with the Lifetime Achievement Award, the association's highest honor, in recognition of their outstanding career in music and contribution to the music profession. In 1990, Jim was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and, for the past fifteen years, he was cared for at home. Jim is survived by his wife, Jane Smisor Bastien; his two daughters, Lisa Bastien Hanss and her husband Basil, and Lori Bastien Vickers and her husband Eric. There are four grandchildren, Katie and Julie Hanss and Abby and Riley Vickers. A Memorial Concert will be held at the La Jolla Presbyterian Church on Saturday, January 28, 2006, at 2 P.M. where Jim's former student, Dr. Robert Roux, chair of the piano department at Rice University, Houston, Texas, will perform. A reception will follow immediately in the church fellowship hall.

"You just can't separate mystery and place. If the fictional Kurt Wallander lived in New York or London, he would still be the kind of tortured detective whom readers and viewers identify with. He's divorced, he drinks, his father has Alzheimer's disease, and he often wonders unhappily what the world is coming to. His only pleasure, it sometimes seems, is listening to opera in his police car. But there's something about Wallander's base of operations -- Ystad, Sweden, a small Baltic seaside town near Malmo -- that colors him gloomy and adds a satisfyingly gray touch to the mysteries he investigates. It may also help explain his total lack of humor. Beginning on Wednesday night and running through July 13, the American Scandinavian Foundation is screening ''Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander Mysteries,'' four 90-minute television films, written by Mr. Mankell, the author of the internationally best-selling Wallander novels. (Keep in mind that Ingmar Bergman has done some of his best work, including ''Scenes From a Marriage,'' for Swedish television.) The murders that Wallander (Krister Henriksson) investigates include those of a wealthy couple found in their grand home, of an African man whose body is found on a train and of an American tourist visiting a famous Swedish photographer. (Above, Johanna Sallstrom in the episode ''Mastermind.'') Then, on July 19, screenings of the 2005 Danish drama series ''Ornen'' (''The Eagle'') begin. That show, which won an International Emmy Award, stars Jens Albinus as Hallgrim Orn Hallgrimsson, an Icelandic-born police inspector whose specialties appear to be international organized crime and existential crises.

The employee, Sandra McMikle, who has worked for the Department of Education for about 25 years, was assigned to process reimbursement claims for transportation and other supplemental education services. From 2001 to this year, she submitted more than 40 fraudulent claims for services to a fictitious child, investigators said. The claims identified Ms. McMikle's mother, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, as the person to be reimbursed for expenses on behalf of the fictitious child, investigators said. Ms. McMikle told investigators that she had ""tried it once to see if it would work,"" then began submitting claims regularly, a report said. The city paid the claims until January, when Ms. McMikle's colleagues became suspicious of awkward wording and obsolete case numbers in the documents, the report said. Ms. McMikle told investigators that her mother was unaware of the fraudulent claims, the report said. She pleaded not guilty at her arraignment yesterday.

" INTERNATIONAL A3-16    North Korea Responds To U.S. Talk of Sanctions  North Korea said it would consider sanctions a ''declaration of a war'' and vowed to carry out further nuclear tests if the United States maintained a ''hostile attitude.''  A14    President Bush said that he would not use force against North Korea because ''diplomacy hasn't run its course,'' but acknowledged that many Americans wonder why he invaded Iraq but has not taken military action to head off the North's race for a bomb.  A16    Court Revises British Libel Law  Britain's highest court ruled for the first time that newspapers have the right to publish allegations about public figures, as long as their reporting is responsible and in the public interest.  A10    China Shifts Economic Policy  China's Communist Party, devoted in recent years to expanding the economy, endorsed a new doctrine that puts more emphasis on tackling the severe side effects of unrestrained growth.  A14    Iraq Approves Autonomy Law  Iraq's Shiite-dominated Parliament approved a law enabling provinces to join together to form autonomous regions, in spite of vehement opposition by Sunni Arab leaders who said it could splinter the republic.  A12    The senior American commander in Iraq said that violence in Baghdad had reached its highest levels ever in recent weeks, despite the presence of thousands of additional American and Iraqi troops who were shifted into the capital in August.  A12    Brazilians Seek Crash Answers  As salvage crews searched for the last nine bodies of the 154 people killed in an apparent midair collision over Brazil on Sept. 29, victims' families and the public were criticizing the investigation for what they said was a lack of transparency.   A6    NATIONAL A18-26    Drugs Used for Alzheimer's Offer No Help, Study Finds  The drugs most commonly used to soothe agitation and aggression in people with Alzheimer's disease are no more effective than placeboes for most patients and may have serious side effects, researchers say.  A1    Bush Predicts G.O.P. Victory  President Bush predicted that Republicans would be victorious in November, declaring that positive economic signs, combined with tough rhetoric against Democrats on national security, would help lift his party on Election Day.  A24    Treason Charge for American  The Justice Department charged an American with treason, accusing a former Southern California man of giving ''aid and comfort'' to Al Qaeda by appearing in a series of highly publicized videotapes urging violence against the United States.  A22    Voting Rights for Felons  Legislatures in 16 states have loosened voting restrictions on felons over the last decade, according to a new report, a trend hailed by some rights advocates as a step toward democratic principles and fairness, especially for black Americans.  A18    Governor's Aide is Indicted  Accusations of political corruption drew closer to Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois as a federal grand jury indicted one of his top advisers and fund-raisers in what prosecutors call a kickback scheme involving state pension funds less than a month before Election Day.  A20    Courts' Relationship Pondered  The relationship between the federal and state courts, as redefined by a 10-year-old federal law that greatly restricted the federal courts' ability to set aside state convictions through writs of habeas corpus, is being tested by a case in San Francisco.  A20    NEW YORK/REGION B1-8    Yankees Pitcher Killed As Plane Hits High-Rise  A single-engine plane carrying the Yankees pitcher Cory Lidle smashed into a 42-story building on the Upper East Side, killing Mr. Lidle and his flight instructor, the authorities said. Eleven firefighters and four people in the building were injured, officials said.  A1    Spitzer's Road to Success  Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who is running for governor of New York, has a résumé that practically guaranteed him a life as a rich lawyer.

"The American Scandinavian Foundation is screening ""Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander Mysteries"" and the 2005 Danish drama series ""Ornen"" (""The Eagle"") .",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/16/movies/16bmovi.html,"The American Scandinavian Foundation is screening ""Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander Mysteries"" and the 2005 Danish drama series ""Ornen"" (""The Eagle"") .","You just can't separate mystery and place. If the fictional Kurt Wallander lived in New York or London, he would still be the kind of tortured detective whom readers and viewers identify with. He's divorced, he drinks, his father has Alzheimer's disease, and he often wonders unhappily what the world is coming to. His only pleasure, it sometimes seems, is listening to opera in his police car. But there's something about Wallander's base of operations — Ystad, Sweden, a small Baltic seaside town near Malmo — that colors him gloomy and adds a satisfyingly gray touch to the mysteries he investigates. It may also help explain his total lack of humor. Beginning on Wednesday night and running through July 13, the American Scandinavian Foundation is screening ""Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander Mysteries,"" four 90-minute television films, written by Mr. Mankell, the author of the internationally best-selling Wallander novels. (Keep in mind that Ingmar Bergman has done some of his best work, including ""Scenes From a Marriage,"" for Swedish television.) The murders that Wallander (Krister Henriksson) investigates include those of a wealthy couple found in their grand home, of an African man whose body is found on a train and of an American tourist visiting a famous Swedish photographer. (Above, Johanna Sallstrom in the episode ""Mastermind."") Then, on July 19, screenings of the 2005 Danish drama series ""Ornen"" (""The Eagle"") begin. That show, which won an International Emmy Award, stars Jens Albinus as Hallgrim Orn Hallgrimsson, an Icelandic-born police inspector whose specialties appear to be international organized crime and existential crises. (The series runs through Aug. 10. Scandinavia House, 58 Park Avenue, between 37th and 38th Streets, 212-879-9779; $8.)",E,21,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Denmark', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'American Scandinavian Foundation', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'Sweden', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MOTION PICTURES', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Television', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}]",2006-06-16T04:00:00+0000,article,Weekend,Movies,News,nyt://article/e87a55ab-f2a4-5723-bc36-1003a9ffa227,281,nyt://article/e87a55ab-f2a4-5723-bc36-1003a9ffa227,Nordic Noir: Crime Dramas From Sweden and Denmark,Critic's Choice,,,,,,Anita Gates,"[{'firstname': 'Anita', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Gates', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,Alzheimer,
Was Ebenezer Scrooge actually sick?,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/17/magazine/17wwln_diagnosis.t.html,Was Ebenezer Scrooge actually sick?,"A lonely old man sits at home one Christmas Eve and has a series of unexpected visitors: the restless spirit of his long-dead business partner, followed by the ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future. By morning, this wretched, miserly recluse has been transformed into the season’s icon of exuberant celebration. This is, of course, the story of Ebenezer Scrooge — the way Charles Dickens wrote it in his novella “A Christmas Carol.” But there’s another way to tell this familiar tale: an elderly man with no known medical problems has a sudden change in mental status characterized by confusion and vivid hallucinations involving friends and relatives, which leaves him in a state of trembling mania and uncharacteristic euphoria. This also describes Ebenezer Scrooge — but as a doctor might see him. What caused these extraordinary symptoms? a doctor might ask. Could some pathological process have accounted for Scrooge’s remarkable experience?",,,The New York Times,"[{'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'popup', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2006/12/15/magazine/17diag.450.jpg', 'height': 1288, 'width': 414, 'legacy': {}, 'subType': 'popup', 'crop_name': 'popup'}, {'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'articleInline', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2006/12/15/magazine/17diag.190.jpg', 'height': 469, 'width': 190, 'legacy': {}, 'subType': 'articleInline', 'crop_name': 'articleInline'}, {'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'thumbnail', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2006/12/15/magazine/17diag.75.jpg', 'height': 75, 'width': 75, 'legacy': {'thumbnail': 'images/2006/12/15/magazine/17diag.75.jpg', 'thumbnailwidth': 75, 'thumbnailheight': 75}, 'subType': 'thumbnail', 'crop_name': 'thumbStandard'}]","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Medicine and Health', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Dickens, Charles', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",2006-12-17T05:00:00+0000,article,Magazine,Magazine,News,nyt://article/f771b24d-b5c2-56e4-8c65-2134d44c966b,1363,nyt://article/f771b24d-b5c2-56e4-8c65-2134d44c966b,Diagnosing With Dickens,Diagnosis,,Diagnosing With Dickens,,,,"By Lisa Sanders, M.d","[{'firstname': 'Lisa', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Sanders', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}, {'firstname': None, 'middlename': None, 'lastname': None, 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 2}]",,Alzheimer,

"WEILL--Guy A., 1914-2006. Guy Weill was born in 1914 in Zurich, Switzerland, and died August 17, 2006 at home in New York City. He is survived by his devoted wife of 63 years, Marie-Helene Bigar Weill, his loving daughters Claudia, Kathryn and Patricia Weill, his adored grandchildren Emily and Alison Goldfrank, Sam and Eli Teller and their father, Walter S.Teller, and his beloved sister, Marianne Lester. He was 92 years old. Arriving in the United States in 1938, Guy served as a captain in the U.S. Army. With his command of languages, he was assigned to the Military Intelligence Service attached to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's headquarters for interrogation of prisoners of war in Morocco, Italy and France. While a translator for the post-war team interrogating Nazi officials prior to the Nuremberg trials, Guy drew caricatures of war criminals and quizzed Goering about his preferences in art. He received a Bronze Star. Soon after World War II, he started British American House, an exclusive menswear store, which was the first to import Burberry and Aquascutum to the United States. Guy was an avid artist and collected art since he was a young man, beginning with Picasso drawings, contemporary Eu ropean painting and continuing with German Expressionists. When he came to the United States, he was emotionally liberated by the size and expressive content of the Abstract Expressionists many of whom he befriended, often trading a sketch for a raincoat. Forty years ago, Guy and his wife, Marie-H l ne, discovered Asian art when she became a lecturer at the China Institute Gallery. Self trained, his eye was legendary, as could be seen in his photographs exhibited in a one-man show in 1982 at the Asia Society, where they remain permanently on view. In 2002, Chinese paintings that the Weills collected were the subject of a memorable show, ''The Cultivated Landscape,'' at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

He is survived by his devoted wife of 63 years, Marie-Helene Bigar Weill, his loving daughters Claudia, Kathryn and Patricia Weill, his adored grandchildren Emily and Alison Goldfrank, Sam and Eli Teller and their father, Walter S.Teller, and his beloved sister, Marianne Lester. He was 92 years old. Arriving in the United States in 1938, Guy served as a captain in the U.S. Army. With his command of languages, he was assigned to the Military Intelligence Service attached to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's headquarters for interrogation of prisoners of war in Morocco, Italy and France. While a translator for the post-war team interrogating Nazi officials prior to the Nuremberg trials, Guy drew caricatures of war criminals and quizzed Goering about his preferences in art. He received a Bronze Star. Soon after World War II, he started British American House, an exclusive menswear store, which was the first to import Burberry and Aquascutum to the United States. Guy was an avid artist and collected art since he was a young man, beginning with Picasso drawings, contemporary Eu ropean painting and continuing with German Expressionists. When he came to the United States, he was emotionally liberated by the size and expressive content of the Abstract Expressionists many of whom he befriended, often trading a sketch for a raincoat. Forty years ago, Guy and his wife, Marie-H l ne, discovered Asian art when she became a lecturer at the China Institute Gallery. Self trained, his eye was legendary, as could be seen in his photographs exhibited in a one-man show in 1982 at the Asia Society, where they remain permanently on view. In 2002, Chinese paintings that the Weills collected were the subject of a memorable show, ''The Cultivated Landscape,'' at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. They were also affiliated with other institutions including Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard University, Arthur M. Sackler Gallery at Smithsonian Institution and the Brooklyn Museum.

By Shari Goldhagen. (Doubleday, cloth, $23.95; Broadway, paper, $14.) Goldhagen honed her writing chops by covering celebrities for The National Enquirer and other gossip sheets, but in her assured first novel she focuses on the ordinary, mostly befuddled relationship between two brothers over the course of 25 years. Jack and Connor Reed were orphaned early, while Connor was still in high school, leaving Jack to raise him for a few years and sealing the tenuous but resilient bond that will connect them through marriages, affairs, children, divorces, career changes and health crises -- all the stuff of life, in other words, that anchors this affecting family portrait. The brothers aren't always likable (Jack, in particular, can be self-centered, cold and impulsive), and there's nothing dazzling about Goldhagen's narrative style: in exploring the tug of war between desire and family duty, she concentrates mainly on domestic details and interior lives. But she covers the familiar terrain with vitality -- this is real life with snappier dialogue -- and as the points of view expand to encompass the brothers' wives and children, her book reminds you that simply paying attention is one of the things literature can do best.",7,20,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Panzer, Mary', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Berg, Elizabeth', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Lawrence, Starling', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'GOLDHAGEN, SHARI', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'DEAN, DEBRA', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'TUCKER, LISA', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Books and Literature', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'LIGHTNING KEEPER, THE (BOOK)', 'rank': 8, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'ONCE UPON A DAY (BOOK)', 'rank': 9, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'THINGS AS THEY ARE (BOOK)', 'rank': 10, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'MADONNAS OF LENINGRAD, THE (BOOK)', 'rank': 11, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'FAMILY AND OTHER ACCIDENTS (BOOK)', 'rank': 12, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'WE ARE ALL WELCOME HERE (BOOK)', 'rank': 13, 'major': 'N'}]",2006-04-30T05:00:00+0000,article,Book Review Desk,Books,Review,nyt://article/e46af283-6ab8-5b7f-bbcd-aaf6f43f5ab3,1251,nyt://article/e46af283-6ab8-5b7f-bbcd-aaf6f43f5ab3,Fiction Chronicle,,,Fiction Chronicle,,,,By Gregory Cowles,"[{'firstname': 'Gregory', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Cowles', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,Alzheimer,

" INTERNATIONAL A3-12    Israel Bombards Lebanon After Hezbollah Hits Haifa  The Lebanese militia Hezbollah unleashed its deadliest missile yet on Israel, killing eight people in the city of Haifa. Israeli warplanes struck targets in southern Beirut and southern Lebanon, killing 45 people and wounding more than 100, according to local reports. The impact of the deaths on both sides and the missile strike marked a qualitative and psychological escalation of the conflict on its fifth day.  A1    The Lebanese militia Hezbollah fired 10 powerful rockets -- a kind it has never unleashed before -- which traveled more than 20 miles over northern Israel before slamming down in Haifa. The attack confirmed what Israeli security chiefs have warned for years: that Hezbollah has large, powerful rockets able to reach major Israeli cities.  A8    Arabs Publicly Blame Hezbollah  Arab governments are taking the rare step of publicly blaming Hezbollah. Saudi Arabia, supported by Jordan, Egypt, several Gulf states and the Palestinian Authority, chastised Hezbollah for ''unexpected, inappropriate and irresponsible acts'' at an emergency Arab League summit meeting in Cairo.  A1    Tacit U.S. Approval for Israel  The Bush administration appeared to give Israel tacit approval to cripple Hezbollah, casting the conflict in the Middle East in terms of a wider war on terrorism. That was a central theme of both public and private statements from senior American officials, even as President Bush and his aides issued a statement including a request for restraint in Israel's attacks on Lebanon.  A10    Group of 8 Focuses on Oil  The world leaders at a Group of 8 summit meeting issued a communiqué on energy policy that touched lightly on alternatives to fossil fuels, like biomass and wind power, but focused mostly on how to bring more oil to the market.  A11    Sunnis Shift View of U.S. in Iraq  As sectarian violence soars, many Sunni Arab political and religious leaders once staunchly opposed to the American presence in Iraq are now saying they need American troops to protect them from the rampages of Shiite militias and Shiite-run government forces.  A1    Iraqi Officials' Safety Shaken  Gunmen in vehicles resembling those used by Iraqi security forces kidnapped Adil Mohamed al-Qazaz, president of one of Iraq's state-owned oil companies in Baghdad, an Oil Ministry spokesman said. The abduction underscored the danger that high-level Iraqi officials face and the power of criminal groups who strike at them seemingly at will.  A12    2nd Mexican Recount Protest  For the second time in a little over a week, thousands of supporters of the leftist presidential candidate, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, filled Mexico City's central plaza to demonstrate their support for his demand for a recount in the disputed election.  A3    NATIONAL A13-15    Hospitals and Vendors Are Under Scrutiny  While the financial relationship between doctors and drug companies has come under intense scrutiny, much less is known about how hospital executives interact with companies that sell them drugs, medical equipment and financial services.  A1    Aid Arrives for Gulf Coast  Nearly $10 billion in federal aid is starting to flow into the hands of people in Mississippi and Louisiana who lost their houses in last year's hurricanes, the culmination of a year of political battling and bargaining between the states and Washington.  A1    A Reward for Arizona Voters  A proposal to award $1 million in every general election to one lucky Arizona resident simply for voting -- no matter for whom -- has qualified for the November ballot. Mark Osterloh, left, a political gadfly who is behind the initiative, is promoting it with the slogan ''Who wants to be a Millionaire? Vote!''  A1    Plan Cuts Medicare Payments  The Bush administration says it plans sweeping changes in Medicare payments to hospitals that could cut payments by 20 percent to 30 percent for many complex treatments and new technologies. The changes, the biggest since the current payment system was adopted in 1983, are meant to improve the accuracy of payment rates.  A13    SCIENCE/HEALTH    A Diabetes- Alzheimer's Link?  Several new studies suggest that diabetes increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease, adding to a store of evidence that links the disorders. The studies involve only Type 2 diabetes, the most common type, which is usually related to obesity.  A15    Discovery Gets the All-Clear  The space shuttle Discovery is coming home, buoyed by positive tests and inspections indicating the spacecraft is in good shape for a landing in Florida following a 13-day mission to the International Space Station.  A13    OBITUARIES B7    Winthrop Paul Rockefeller  A lieutenant governor of Arkansas who followed his family's twin traditions of philanthropy and politics in the state adopted by his father, he was 57.  B7    Dr. James A. Nicholas  A pioneer in the treatment of athletic injuries who was best known for performing four knee operations that saved the celebrated career of the Jets quarterback Joe Namath, he was 85.  B7    Carrie Nye  A stage, film and television actress and a fixture at the Williamstown Theater Festival, she was 69.  B7    NEW YORK/REGION B1-6    Bloomberg Commission Addresses Poverty in City  Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's Commission on Economic Opportunity has been focused on how to solve the problem of rising poverty in a city as wealthy as New York. They found that the solution is employment, and rather than pumping benefits into households, they want the government to use more of its resources to allow people to enter the work force -- and stay in it.  B1    Church Divided Over Gays  Though All Angels Church in New York City is a theologically conservative branch of the Episcopal Church, it serves a liberal diocese. But the church has joined the national battle over the promotion of a gay bishop, and this month will take a major step toward cleaving itself from the denomination by formally joining the Anglican Communion Network.  B1    WNYC Relocating Next Year  After broadcasting for the last 82 years from the Municipal Building in Manhattan, WNYC, which has the largest audience of any public radio station in the United States, is moving. No longer will its 18 journalists be jammed into a shoebox of a newsroom, and guests will wait in an actual green room, not out in the hall at the water cooler.  B1    Program for Disabled Ailing  New York State has prevented thousands of disabled people from receiving walkers and wheelchairs by delaying or denying their requests in violation of state and federal rules, according to an investigation by the State Assembly.  B5    SPORTSMONDAY D1-8    400th Save for Rivera  Mariano Rivera, left, of the Yankees, earned the 400th save of his career in a pressurized 6-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox . The play concluded what may have been the team's best weekend of the season and it came against the defending World Series champions before 54,781 fans at Yankee Stadium.  D1    Injuries on Tour de France  Two riders in the Tour de France, a Belgian cyclist with the French Cofidis team and a Spaniard on the Saunier Duval-Prodir team, ended their tours with a visit to the hospital after violent falls some 25 miles from the end of the stage, which was won by Pierrick Fedrigo.  D1    ARTS E1-8    Long-Term 'Talent' at NBC  ''America's Got Talent,'' the singing, dancing, juggling and ventriloquizing new reality talent competition, has posted solid ratings in each of its four outings on NBC this summer. But the numbers, while strong, have been just tenuous enough to leave some doubt about whether it can break through as a genuine hit in the regular season.  E1    BUSINESS DAY C1-12    Airbus Plans New Project  Airbus, desperate to pull out of the worst downturn in its history, plans to disclose details of a radically redesigned midsize plane, a $10 billion project that will compete with Boeing's 787, executives said.  C1    Backdating Option Grants  More than 2,000 companies appear to have used backdated stock options to sweeten their chief executives' pay packages, according to a new study that suggests the practice is far more widespread than previously disclosed.  C1    Disney Alters Movie Division  Walt Disney Studios will soon announce a major reorganization of its live-action movie division, which will alter the way Disney movies are made and marketed, according to several people briefed on the plan.  C3    New Technology from H.P.  Researchers at Hewlett-Packard are set to introduce a new technology that they say will allow large amounts of information to be stored on tiny chips attached to objects. The stored information might include video, sound and text.

Why not humans? Scientists try to harness the genes that let animals replace lost body parts.,"Stem cell therapy has long captured the limelight as a way to the goal of regenerative medicine, that of repairing the body with its own natural systems. But a few scientists, working in a relatively obscure field, believe another path to regenerative medicine may be as likely to succeed. The less illustrious approach is promising, in their view, because it is the solution that nature itself has developed for repairing damaged limbs or organs in a wide variety of animals.

He grew grim and determined-steely. Out of nowhere, he unleashed a string of expletives.”"," EARLY ON the afternoon of May 1, 2002, George W. Bush slipped out of the Oval Office, grabbed a tennis racquet, and headed to the South Lawn. He had a few spare moments for one of his recreational pleasures: whacking tennis balls to his dogs, Spot and Barney. It was a pleasant spring day in Washington and not an especially taxing one for the president. He had no pressing political worries. Having routed the Taliban regime in Afghanistan the previous fall, Bush was standing tall in the polls, with an approval rating hovering at 70 percent. That morning, there had been his usual terrorism briefings, then meetings with congressional leaders where Bush had talked about moving forward his domestic proposals, including a measure promoting faith-based social programs. Later in the day, the president was due to meet the vice president of China. Bush also had an unusual press interview on his schedule that afternoon. As he hit the balls and watched the dogs scamper, Bush prepared for that session with two press aides by reviewing questions he would likely be asked about one of his predecessors he admired most: Ronald Reagan.

It was embarrassingly hard to find the money, and Emma Lazarus, a much published and well-connected poet, was asked to contribute a poem for a fund-raiser. Her sonnet, “The New Colossus,” imagined the statue — called “Liberty Enlightening the World” — addressing the Old World with majestic brusqueness: “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp! ... Give me your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” Today, some of Lazarus’s alliteration seems heavy-handed — “world-wide welcome,” “wretched refuse” — but the closing lines still have the power to raise goosebumps.

" INTERNATIONAL A3-10    China and South Korea Say Trade With North Will Go On  Questions over the effectiveness of the Security Council's punitive sanctions on North Korea for its claimed nuclear test grew, as both South Korea and China -- the North's two most important trading partners -- indicated that business and economic relations would largely be unaffected.  A1    U.S. Deaths in Iraq Accelerate  Two marines were killed by insurgents in Anbar Province, the American military command said, and three American soldiers died a day earlier in a bombing in southern Baghdad, bringing the total of American troop deaths in Iraq this month to at least 53, a rate of almost four a day.  A9    7 Killed, 1 Taken in Afghanistan  Two Canadian soldiers in the NATO force were killed and three were wounded in an ambush in southern Afghanistan, an Afghan provincial council member was assassinated on his way to work, two police officers were killed near the border with Pakistan, two civilians were killed by a bomb, and an Italian photojournalist was reported to have been kidnapped by gunmen in southern Afghanistan.  A6    Israeli Official May Be Charged  After a nearly two-month inquiry, the Israeli police released a statement recommending that President Moshe Katsav face charges of rape and sexual assault allegedly committed against several women in his office. Israel's attorney general, Menachem Mazuz, must now decide whether to file such charges. A8    Video Disputes China's Claim  A videotape that appears to show Chinese security forces shooting two Tibetan refugees in the Himalayas contradicts Beijing's claim that the refugees were shot when soldiers acted in self-defense. The New China News Agency said soldiers acted after refugees seeking to cross illegally into Nepal from China attacked border troops. A6    The Chinese police have charged a prominent human rights lawyer with inciting subversion, part of a crackdown on people who have sought to use China's nascent legal system to limit the power of the state. He was taken into custody in mid-August, but the police only recently made clear the nature of the charge, his lawyer said.  A6    Thai AIDS Patients Shunned  Thailand's primary AIDS hospice, once a place of certain death, is now becoming overcrowded by people whose lives have been saved by medication but are rejected by their families or neighbors. Thailand has become a pioneer in distributing low-cost drugs, which are available for all those who need them for less than a dollar per treatment.  A8    Pope Names 4 Saints  Pope Benedict XVI named four saints, among them two nuns who pioneered schools for women, including schools in the wilds of 19th-century frontier Indiana. The canonization ceremony was the second round of saints named by Benedict since he became pope in April 2005.  A4    NATIONAL A12-17    Party Leaders Shift Focus To Winnable Campaigns  The choices being made by top Republican and Democratic leaders are setting the strategic framework of the final weeks of Congressional campaigning. They signal, by where they are spending television money and other resources, the Senate and House races where they believe they have the best chance of success.  A1    Tony Snow, the White House press secretary and former television commentator and radio host, is using his star power and conservative bona fides in a controversial and unprecedented way: by raising money for Republican candidates.   A16    Coast Guard to Arm Lake Boats  United States Coast Guard officials want to mount machine guns on their cutters and small boats around the Great Lakes as a counterterrorism measure, and plan to hold live fire exercises on the lakes. Some residents of the lakeside towns consider the idea to be potentially dangerous to ordinary boaters and a surprising place to be bracing for terrorists.  A1    Earthquake Rocks Hawaii  An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.6 rippled through the Hawaii islands, knocking out electrical power and triggering a landslide that rained boulders and debris on a major highway on the largest island.  A12    Power Supply Trails Demand  Companies are not building power plants and power lines fast enough to meet growing demand, according to a group recently assigned by the federal government to assure proper operation of the power grid.   A14    Players Maintain Innocence  Three former Duke University students told the CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' that they were falsely accused of raping a woman hired to dance at a lacrosse team party.   A14    SCIENCE/HEALTH    Scientists Aid Paralyzed Man  A team of neuroscientists reported that it had restored some movement and speech to a severely brain-damaged man by stimulating his brain with pulses of electric current.   A14    NEW YORK/REGION B1-7    Pirro and Cuomo Clash In First Televised Debate  The New York attorney general's race, one of the most combative and colorful political contests in recent memory, turned ever nastier as the two candidates, Jeanine F. Pirro and Andrew M. Cuomo, spent an hour attacking and undercutting each other in their first televised debate.  A1    Final Concert for CBGB  Last night was the last concert at CBGB, the famously crumbling rock club that has been in continuous, loud operation since December 1973. It served as the casual headquarters and dank incubator for some of New York's most revered groups, as well as thousands more whose blares left less of a mark on history but whose graffiti and concert fliers might still remain on its walls. B1    Lawyer Faces Sentencing  Lynne F. Stewart, the lawyer who was convicted of aiding terrorists almost two years ago, will be sentenced in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The prosecution is seeking to condemn Ms. Stewart to 30 years in prison.  B1    SPORTSMONDAY D1-10    Mets Win Evens Series  The Mets rolled to a 12-5 victory against the Cardinals in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series at Busch Stadium, evening their best-of-seven series at two games apiece.  D1    A New Power on L.P.G.A. Tour  In a final-round duel at the Samsung World Championship, one of the L.P.G.A. Tour's biggest tournaments, Lorena Ochoa shot a final-round, seven-under-par 65 to defeat Annika Sorenstam by two shots, signaling a potential power shift on a tour Sorenstam has ruled.  D4    ARTS E1-10    Renaissance Panels Tour U.S.  Three newly restored panels from the bronze doors known as ''The Gates of Paradise,'' which were designed for the Piazza del Duomo in Florence during the Renaissance, are scheduled to tour North America for the first time.

Louis.","OOGA-BOOGA. By Frederick Seidel. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) Having delivered his fin-de-siècle masterpiece, “The Cosmos Trilogy,” in 2003, Seidel could certainly be forgiven for taking it easy this next time out, but he needn’t be cut any slack: these new poems are as beguiling and magisterial as anything the septuagenarian jet-setter has written. I can’t decide whether Seidel has more in common with Philip Larkin or John Ashbery, but the fact that he can prompt such a bizarre question is more revealing than any possible answer. Like Larkin, Seidel can seem a gimlet-eyed grouch whose compassion oozes to the surface despite himself, as in “A Fresh Stick of Chewing Gum,” a denunciation-cum-celebration of youth that concludes with a pensive “blank” nearly identical to the “nowhere” near the end of Larkin’s similarly arch “High Windows.” And like Ashbery, Seidel takes nearly pathological delight in the musical flotsam and jetsam of contemporary usage: “I’m getting young. / I’m totally into strapping on the belt of dynamite / Which will turn me into light. / God is great! I suck Her tongue.” Another poet might have thought to begin a stanza with the line “The most expensive hotel in the world ignites,” but probably only this one would follow it with “As many orgasms as there are virgins in paradise.” I hope Seidel wears a helmet while riding his beloved Ducati; it would be intolerable to see this great strange brain spilled.
