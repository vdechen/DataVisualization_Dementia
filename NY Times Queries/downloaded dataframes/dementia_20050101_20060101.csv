" When it comes to taste in movies, it figures that STEPHEN SONDHEIM's should be as broad, unpredictable and perverse as the subjects he chooses for musicals, no one of which is like any other. Even so, certain themes that recur in this master game player's shows also tend to crop up in his favorite movies.    Starting on Sunday and continuing through Jan. 8, 15 of those favorites will be shown by the MUSEUM OF MODERN ART at the Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters in the museum's Artist's Choice series. Mr. Sondheim's selections attest to his fondness for difficulty, challenge and iconoclasm.    The composer's fascination with horror and the macabre, which culminated in his ''Sweeney Todd,'' is reflected in the 1945 British film ''DEAD OF NIGHT'' -- a collection of five creepy vignettes, the last of which involves a ventriloquist and his dummy -- and also in the 2003 film ''ELEPHANT,'' Gus Van Sant's detached, minimalist take on the Columbine murders.    The intellectual debates among Canadian academics in Denys Arcand's ''BARBARIAN INVASIONS'' (2003) echo Mr. Sondheim's cultivated, subtext-loaded conversational lyrics; his elegant, aristocratic sensibility finds a corollary in Stanley Kubrick's ''BARRY LYNDON'' (1975).    George Bernard Shaw's play ''Pygmalion,'' which became a film in 1938, later became the Lerner and Loewe musical ''MY FAIR LADY,'' which Mr. Sondheim has called the most perfect realization of the musical-comedy form, while François Truffaut's ''STORY OF ADELE H,'' with its tale of romantic obsession and dementia, anticipated the Sondheim musical ''Passion,'' which was adapted from an Italian film, ''Passione d'Amore,'' with a similar theme. 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 708-9400",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/arts/the-week-ahead-dec-18dec-24-film.html,"When it comes to taste in movies, it figures that STEPHEN SONDHEIM's should be as broad, unpredictable and perverse as the subjects he chooses for musicals, no one of which is like any other.

" INTERNATIONAL   A3-14    Bush Gives Sharon's Plan Both Support and Criticism  President Bush and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel differed over Israel's intention to expand a settlement in the West Bank, but Mr. Bush gave the Israeli leader backing for his plan to withdraw from Gaza.   A1    Nominee Rebuts Accusations  John R. Bolton, rebutting attacks from Democrats on his fitness to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, pledged to bring about a partnership with the organization and denied ever trying to have anyone dismissed for disagreeing with him on intelligence matters.   A1    Border Settled for Trade's Sake  China and India announced an agreement to resolve a decades-old border dispute and let trade flourish between them.   A9    Islam Issue Awaits New Pope  Many cardinals mentioned as candidates to be the next pope have expressed positions on Islam, and on how confrontational the Roman Catholic Church should be with Muslims.   A14    Insurgents Raided in Baghdad  Hundreds of Iraqi troops and commandos backed by American soldiers swept through Baghdad capturing at least 65 suspected insurgents in one of the largest raids in the capital since the fall of Saddam Hussein, military officials said.   A6    Confused Response to Virus  The confusion over the diagnosis of the Marburg virus in Angola says much about the state of African health care and reflects the chaos and common misery of a continent with the lowest life expectancy rate in the world.   A3    NATIONAL   A15-19    U.S. Accuses 15 States Of Medicaid Improprieties  The Bush administration named 15 states that it said had used improper accounting techniques to obtain excessive amounts of federal Medicaid money.   A15    Bomb Scare at U.S. Capitol  Police officers tackled and forcibly removed a man who was carrying two suitcases near the Capitol, saying he was uncooperative when they sought to question him. The authorities feared that he might be a suicide bomber.   A16    Trial Opens in Grenade Attack  An Army sergeant charged with killing two officers and wounding 14 others in a grenade attack on his own camp in Kuwait was mentally ill and acted not out of premeditation but desperation, his lawyer said.   A15    Dementia Patients at Risk  Elderly patients with dementia who are given antipsychotic medicines are almost twice as likely to die prematurely as those given placebo treatments, federal drug regulators said.   A17    Pet Projects Pack Spending Bill  Senators seized on a rare chance to pack pet projects into a supplemental military spending bill put forth by President Bush, adding provisions on oil drilling, a new baseball stadium for Washington and economic aid to Palestinians.   A18    Panel Hears Silicone Debate  A federal advisory panel heard from many women on both sides of the debate over silicone breast implants. Some women argued that the implants, whose use is restricted, should be more broadly available.   A17    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-6    Videos Contradict Claims Of Convention Disorder  Videos taken by private citizens and police officers have shifted the debate over precisely what happened on the streets of New York during the Republican National Convention. For at least 400 people arrested that week, recordings have provided persuasive evidence that they did not commit a crime, prosecutors and defense lawyers say.   A1    Gambling Riches Fade  New York State's plan to rely on gambling parlors full of slot-machine-like video lottery terminals to help finance increases in education aid is not paying off nearly as much as officials had hoped, state data shows.

Greenberg, the former chairman of American International Group who is at the center of a wide-ranging investigation into possible financial manipulation, plans to exercise his right against self-incrimination and will not answer regulators' questions today, his lawyer said.

"   EARLY BIRD. By Rodney Rothman. (Simon & Schuster, $23.) Here's hoping that Rothman has overcome his nasty fabrication habit, because if the stories and people in his new book, ''Early Bird,'' are real, he has produced a warm, wry bit of reportage. Rothman earned some ignominy in 2000 when an article he wrote for The New Yorker turned out to have fictions mixed in with its facts, causing the magazine to run an apology. That article involved his posing as an employee at a dot-com company, and in ''Early Bird'' Rodman poses again, in a way: he retires to Florida, in his late 20's, moving into a Century Village senior citizens' complex. Rothman manages to be both an observer of these strange beings about three times his age and a sad-sack newcomer trying to blend in with them. He is working a bit of a stereotype, but his descriptions of the loneliness, the cliquishness, the slow-motion desperation of the place ring true and bittersweet. Most surprising is that his tales contain not an ounce of mean-spiritedness -- this from someone who once wrote for David Letterman. ''Young people often think old people all look the same,'' he writes in a passage typical of his tone, ''but that misconception works both ways. To elderly people, young people merge into one tender pink blob. Elderly people always seem to think I am 18 or 19, which is flattering until I remember that their eyesight is failing and that a certain percentage of them suffer from dementia.'' Can't wait for the sitcom, which is already in the pilot stage.       DEMOCRACY AND POPULISM: Fear and Hatred. By John Lukacs. (Yale University, $25.) A good rule of thumb for assessing sociopolitical books is: The more often the name ''Tocqueville'' appears, the more numbing and uninsightful the work will be. There's a quote in Tocqueville's musings to support almost any view, which makes invoking them an exercise in laziness; and besides, how relevant can a guy be who wrote before electricity or rush-hour traffic? So it bodes ill for John Lukacs's ''Democracy and Populism: Fear and Hatred'' that the first word of the preface is ''Tocqueville,'' the first word of the first chapter title is ''Tocqueville's'' and the first two words of that first chapter are ''Alexis'' and ''de.'' But for those willing to read around or through the Tocqueville references, Lukacs, the outspoken historian, provides some satisfyingly inflammatory notions. For instance, on his way to sounding the alarm that democracy is giving way to an intolerant populism, he gleefully packs liberals and conservatives off to hell in the same handbasket: ''By about 1980 there was no overall or even significant difference in the personal behavior (including sexual habits) of liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans, urban and suburban populations.'' Later comes a thought likely to set Rock the Vote types to headbanging: ''There may be room for an argument that, for the sake of proper democracy, voting should be made not easier but more difficult.'' And he offers a provocative guide to polar opposites: ''One of the fundamental differences between extremes of right and left is this: in most instances hatred moves the former; fear the latter.''",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/books/review/nonfiction-chronicle.html,"EARLY BIRD.

" INTERNATIONAL   A3-10    Effort to Aid Victims Of Disaster Gains Strength  The international lifeline to save five million victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami gathered strength as cargo-laden ships and planes converged on stricken coasts, and helicopters ferried food, water and medicines to desperate, isolated survivors.   A1    Economists say that because there is no damage even as little as a mile away from the battered shores in affected countries, there is a perverse likelihood that one of the world's largest-ever human disasters may have a relatively marginal economic impact.   A1    So much aid is now piling up in warehouses and on tarmacs around the Indian Ocean that officials are trying to avert a second potential disaster that often strikes in the aftermath of human tragedies: a lack of coordination among those seeking to help.   A9    Rebel Campaign on Iraqi Forces  Insurgents killed 18 members of the Iraqi national guard and a civilian with a suicide car bomb north of Baghdad. Meanwhile, several police officers and local officials were killed in other attacks around the country.   A1    Abbas Makes Plea to Militants  Mahmoud Abbas, the favorite in the impending Palestinian presidential election, visited the northern Gaza Strip and called on militants to stop firing rockets at Israel. His remarks came just hours after the latest salvos prompted a brief Israeli incursion in the area.   A3    Spanish Leader Faces Crisis  The Basque region's declaration that it has the right to secede from Spain has pushed Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero toward the first crisis of his tenure. Editorial writers and politicians say his affinity for following the polls has kept him from taking on tough issues.   A6    NATIONAL   A11-13    Vigorous Interrogation Expected For Nominee  The Senate Judiciary Committee begins hearings on Thursday to consider President Bush's nomination of Albert R. Gonzales to be attorney general. Mr. Gonzales may face a vigorous interrogation because of his role in overseeing internal legal memorandums that appeared to condone mistreatment of detainees.   A13    Hastert Asserts His Power  J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, has emerged as a powerful force, the man President Bush is counting on to enact his ambitious second-term agenda, including Social Security legislation and changes in the tax code.   A1    New Head for Paramount  A deal that would name the veteran talent manager Brad Grey to head Paramount Pictures is almost finished, people involved in it said. He would replace Sherry Lansing, who announced late last year that she would retire after her contract expired in September 2005.   A11    Bush Celebrates Inauguration  Kelsey Grammer will be the M.C. at a kickoff inaugural gala honoring the military, the rap artist Kid Rock will perform at an inaugural youth concert and President Bush's most reliable fund-raisers have so far collected $15 million for three days of meticulously planned parties to celebrate his second swearing-in.   A13    Former Judge Focus of Case  A retired federal judge who ruled in 1982 that mental hospitals were violating the rights of patients now has dementia and is at the center of a dispute over whether he should be released from his nursing home. As the nation's population ages and the number of Alzheimer's patients rises, the case could have important ramifications.   A11    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-5    White Plains Savors New High-Rise Lifestyle  The construction of 35-story residential towers in White Plains is giving the city something that no other city in Westchester has: a skyline. The project continues the development boom that began two years ago.   B1    Readying for Battle  New York's heavily Democratic delegation on Capitol Hill will battle with conservative lawmakers over federal funds when Congress convenes this month, and New York Republicans may step in to help force concessions.   B1    Pastor Endorses Bloomberg  Mayor Bloomberg accepted the endorsement of the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, the influential pastor of Allen A.M.E. Church in Queens, a significant step toward connecting with non-white voters.

How well it does that may have a profound effect on prospects for continued world growth.

" When Dr. Alan Schiller's 87-year-old mother died in January, ''it took some convincing,'' Schiller says, to get his siblings to agree to an autopsy. ''They said: 'She had Alzheimer's. Let her rest.' But I told them: 'No, something seems funny to me. An autopsy is the only way to be sure.''' Schiller prevailed. A tanned, quick-minded, gregarious man in his 60's, he is naturally persuasive, and as chairman of pathology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, he carries a certain authority regarding autopsies. The word ''autopsy,'' he reminded his siblings, means to ''see for oneself,'' and they should see what happened to their mother. Schiller's mother died in Miami, so he called his friend Dr. Robert Poppiti Jr., chairman of pathology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was on the table the next morning.     In a living patient, Alzheimer's is a diagnosis of exclusion, one that should ideally be reached only by eliminating all testable causes of fading memory and mind. Confirming it requires directly examining the brain. The definitive markers are the tiny protein plaques and fibrous tangles that appear under the microscope in stained sections. But a good pathologist can spot advanced Alzheimer's just by looking at the whole brain. The brain will be shorter, front to back, and more squarish than normal -- a reflection of Alzheimer's neuronal decimation, which shrinks the brain up to 15 percent. This would presumably have been the case with Mrs. Schiller. But the autopsist found her brain of normal shape and size. Dissecting it, he discovered a half-dozen cystlike lesions scattered throughout -- areas darker, softer and less elastic than the buff-colored parts surrounding them.
