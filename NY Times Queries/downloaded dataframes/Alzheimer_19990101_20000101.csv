"To a movie critic, the holiday season now ending might be summed up in a single Shakespearean phrase: ''the winter of our discontent.'' Two of the season's finest films, ''Affliction'' and ''A Simple Plan,'' both set in rural small-town America, are draped in snow. Both are bleak, devastating meditations on human frailty, and yes, discontent. The treacherous landscapes in which they are set make their desperate characters seem all the more weak and fallible.    Speaking of discontent, Hollywood has come up sadly short this season in releasing movies that combine mass appeal with high artistic merit. End-of-the-year crowd-pleasers like ''Stepmom,'' ''Patch Adams,'' and ''You've Got Mail'' are no match against ''Titanic,'' ''Good Will Hunting'' and ''As Good as It Gets,'' the previous holiday season's prestige blockbusters.  ",https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/01/movies/critic-s-notebook-hollywood-hokum-countered-by-venom.html,,"To a movie critic, the holiday season now ending might be summed up in a single Shakespearean phrase: ''the winter of our discontent.'' Two of the season's finest films, ''Affliction'' and ''A Simple Plan,'' both set in rural small-town America, are draped in snow. Both are bleak, devastating meditations on human frailty, and yes, discontent. The treacherous landscapes in which they are set make their desperate characters seem all the more weak and fallible.",E,1,The New York Times,[],[],1999-01-01T05:00:00+0000,article,"Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk",Movies,News,nyt://article/cacc326c-c555-5def-b1a3-e4d0902bd1c0,2242,nyt://article/cacc326c-c555-5def-b1a3-e4d0902bd1c0,Hollywood Hokum Countered by Venom,CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK,,CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; Hollywood Hokum Countered by Venom,,,,By Stephen Holden,"[{'firstname': 'Stephen', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Holden', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,Alzheimer,

AMSTERDAM. By Ian McEwan. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $21.) In this tartly comic novel, winner of the 1998 Booker Prize, the author dispatches his self-important heroes, a composer and an editor, on the very short road from hubris to nemesis.

THE ARTIST'S WIDOW. By Shena Mackay. (Moyer Bell, $21.95.)

(Morrow, $24.) A wrenching novel that embraces two stories: the 20-year friendship of two women in contemporary New York, and the career of an anarchist agitator of the 1920's, a woman who shows up in old age to make a lot of trouble.    THE BOOK OF HAPPINESS. By Nina Berberova. (New Directions, $23.95.) Set in the years surrounding the Russian Revolution, this novel of passionate candor allows its characters to love without irony and to speak ingenuously about what they really want (including happiness).    THE BREAKAGE. By Glyn Maxwell. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.)

Brief interviews with hideous men. By David Foster Wallace. (Little, Brown, $24.) In their depictions of characters whose deviant behavior puts them an angstrom away from undiluted sociopathy, these stories employ an incisive moral sensibility to dissect WASP-y male self-absorption.    CAN YOU WAVE BYE BYE, BABY? Stories. By Elyse Gasco. (Picador USA, $17.) A vivid first story collection, revolving around contentious issues of adoption and parenthood; mothers are uncertain on points of biology and feeling, while fathers may be absent but never suffer doubts.

A Dangerous Friend. By Ward Just. (Peter Davison/Houghton Mifflin, $23.) As its well-meaning civilian hero attempts to find an American officer captured in Vietnam, this novel emerges as an allegory for this country's place in the increasingly deranged world of the mid-1960's.    DEVIL'S VALLEY. By Andre Brink. (Harcourt Brace, $24.) A mythographic novel that resurrects and reburies the Afrikaner past by creating a town, isolated for 150 years, where all is so white a portrait painter forbids himself brown pigments.    DREAMLAND.

By A. S. Byatt. (Random House, $21.95.) In stories that home in on the place where aesthetics and moralism meet, priggish northerners fettered by incuriosity (the greatest crime in the universe of Byatt's creation) are forced to rub shoulders with a warmer-blooded breed -- artists, mostly -- who share an unremitting interest in the world around them.    EMPRESS OF THE SPLENDID SEASON. By Oscar Hijuelos. (HarperFlamingo, $25.) A tender novel, by the author of ''The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' in which a beautiful Cuban emigre who works as a cleaning lady is the victim of a struggle between her instinct for self-invention and her inability to devise a suitable self.

By Amit Chaudhuri. (Knopf, $24.) Brilliant, artfully plotless narratives by a writer less interested in any particular story than in the bits of life and temporary states out of which lives are made.    GAP CREEK. By Robert Morgan. (Algonquin, $22.95.) Rotten luck almost always prevails for the penniless characters in Morgan's third novel, set in rural North Carolina at the turn of the century; but the book sings with its detailed evocations of daily life and strategies for getting through it.

The secret neurosis of a psychiatrist at Harvard leads into an unwanted affair with a colleague's wife in this sendup of psychiatry and the academy.    HEAVY WATER: And Other Stories. By Martin Amis.

IN SEPTEMBER, THE LIGHT CHANGES: Stories. By Andrew Holleran. (Hyperion, $23.95.) Finely made stories, sharply awake to the idioms, cadences and concerns of gay life in the late 20th century, obsessionally aware of the passing of friends, health and youth.    Interpreter Of Maladies: Stories. By Jhumpa Lahiri. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12.) In an elegant debut collection that navigates the cultural border between India and America, people marry in haste and, wondrously, acquire sympathy for their improbable mates at leisure.    THE INTUITIONIST. By Colson Whitehead. (Anchor, $19.95.) An ingenious, original first novel that pits empiricism against intuition in elevator inspection by way of approaching racial struggle and social progress.    ITALIAN FEVER. By Valerie Martin. (Knopf, $22.) Consciousness rather than plot develops in this novel that uses Italy as background to examine the effects of lovemaking on its reflective heroine.    JACKSTRAWS: Poems. By Charles Simic. (Harcourt Brace, $22.) In several poems addressed to the moral and eschatological dimensions of insect life, Simic snatches profundities from the air around him, like so many flies to some wanton boy.    Jem (and Sam). By Ferdinand Mount. (Carroll & Graf, $25.95.) A rollicking novel of the Restoration, told from the viewpoint of one Jeremiah Mount (in real life a drinking buddy of Samuel Pepys and a possible progenitor of the author), who, though gripped by a professional envy that would stagger Salieri, comes at last to find saving grace in failure.    THE JEW OF NEW YORK. By Ben Katchor. (Pantheon, $20.)

A JOURNEY TO THE END OF THE MILLENNIUM. By A. B. Yehoshua. (Doubleday, $24.95.)

Juneteenth. By Ralph Ellison. Edited by John F. Callahan. (Random House, $25.) Assembled by his literary executor from mountains of notes, this story of a racist white senator raised as black may or may not be construed as Ellison's second novel.    KAFKA'S CURSE. By Achmat Dangor. (Pantheon, $22.) A novel of magical fables in which the lies and lunacy of apartheid in the old South Africa continue their work in the new -- when, for instance, a man who had faked his race for a higher notch is metamorphosed into a tree.    THE KIND I'M LIKELY TO GET: A Collection. By Ken Foster. (Quill/Morrow, paper, $12.) Mostly urban short stories about mostly urban characters on whom the author's delicacy and attention confer a measure of lovability, though one wouldn't really want to know them.    THE LAST LIFE. By Claire Messud. (Harcourt Brace, $24.) Messud's second novel concerns the conflicted history of the French who returned from Algiers and the thoughtful, prematurely wise narrator's imaginative efforts to trace that history in her own inner formation.
