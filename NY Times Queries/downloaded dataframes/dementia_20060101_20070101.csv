"''Norman & Beatrice,'' a new play by Barbara Hammond, is subtitled ''A Marriage in Two Acts,'' and this indeed it is: a slice-of-life portrait of a couple as they become familiar with each other through a half century. The onset of Alzheimer's disease in the husband provides an opportunity for Ms. Hammond to celebrate the love and caring that inhere in a happy, 54-year-young marriage. The play is sentimental and clearly affectionate, but it is life sliced thin. Its undoubted warmth and the likability of its title characters will suit undemanding tastes.      We watch the development of the marriage through the wider end of the telescope. The first act is set in 2001, the husband slowly sinking deeper into senile dementia as the wife struggles to keep up with the whirling chaos of his demands and unpredictable behavior. They banter affectionately about golf, about the husband's past career as a local politician, about the children who have long since grown up. In the second act, set 54 years earlier, we see the doubts and joys of the newly married couple, negotiating around their insecurities as they banter affectionately about golf, about the husband's hopes for a career as a local politician, about the first child of the marriage (for she is newly pregnant).

By Lisa Moore. (Black Cat, paper, $13.) It’s hard to think of a more uncomfortable pleasure — or maybe a more pleasing discomfort — than good, strong black comedy. Moore is a Newfoundland writer who brings the pain; her first novel, “Alligator,” intertwines several lives in the maritime harbor city of St. John’s, and the book’s brutal humor may, at its best, put you in mind of Flannery O’Connor. Bad impulses seize each of Moore’s beguiling characters: an obsessed filmmaker who ignores ominous cardiopulmonary warnings; her niece, who experiments with petty thievery and politically motivated vandalism; a young hot-dog vendor who feels threatened by the Russian hoodlum living upstairs. “Alligator” swerves chaotically among their viewpoints, but Moore’s spare, economical writing is full of offhand beauty. Her images are so surefooted they give the impression of having been rendered not merely in the best words available but in the only words imaginable. The nonchalant horror of “Alligator” is gripping, too, as when Moore documents a spreading arson fire: “It traced the invisible ropes of gasoline, it ran down the hallway and into the living room and kitchen and the flames looked like something that had always been there, but had been lying in wait.” ",,,The New York Times,"[{'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'popup', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2006/12/31/books/pruz650.jpg', 'height': 528, 'width': 650, 'legacy': {}, 'subType': 'popup', 'crop_name': 'popup'}, {'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'articleInline', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2006/12/31/books/pruz190.jpg', 'height': 155, 'width': 190, 'legacy': {}, 'subType': 'articleInline', 'crop_name': 'articleInline'}, {'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'thumbnail', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2006/12/31/books/pruz75.jpg', 'height': 75, 'width': 75, 'legacy': {'thumbnail': 'images/2006/12/31/books/pruz75.jpg', 'thumbnailwidth': 75, 'thumbnailheight': 75}, 'subType': 'thumbnail', 'crop_name': 'thumbStandard'}]","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Books and Literature', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Shearer, Harry', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}]",2006-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,BookReview,Books,Review,nyt://article/8ab5534b-dcad-5dfd-9ad2-f09fb10acd15,1067,nyt://article/8ab5534b-dcad-5dfd-9ad2-f09fb10acd15,Fiction Chronicle ,,,,,,,Reviews by Todd Pruzan,"[{'firstname': 'Reviews', 'middlename': 'Todd', 'lastname': 'Pruzan', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,dementia,Book Review

By Mark Binelli. (Dalkey Archive Press, paper, $14.95.) The premise of Binelli’s first novel is unabashedly kooky. What if Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, the anarchist duo whose execution in 1927 was a catalyst for leftist rage, were actually a slapstick comedy team? This notion may seem arbitrary, even trivializing, but it sets the stage for a sweeping narrative encompassing everything from the struggles of Italian-American immigrants to the social dynamics of pie fights. “Of course a respectable gentleman did not walk into a party . . . with the objective of setting off a pie fight,” Sacco muses. His own “problem, or gift, depending on your perspective, was his realization that everyone possesses some potential for mutiny, however buried.” Jumping around in time, Binelli uses imaginary archival documents — film magazine interviews, journal entries and other texts — to depict two comedians, one fat and one thin, who do their time on the vaudeville circuit before graduating to Hollywood vehicles like “Ventriloquism and Its Discontents” and the pie-fight classic “Sacco and Vanzetti Dessert the Cause.” For all their onscreen wackiness, in real life the comedians are habitually stonefaced, as when their neighbor appears at their door inexplicably sporting a beard of bees. “I see you’ve got a beard of bees coming along there, huh? What’s your story?” Sacco asks. “There’s really no need for elaboration,” Vanzetti adds. “It’s clearly difficult for you to speak at the moment, we can tell.” Though Binelli effortlessly captures his characters’ competing voices, his thematic connections are often haphazard, and his story doesn’t end so much as peter to a halt. But its joyful nostalgia, pinpoint characterizations and postmodern brio more than make up for a weak second reel.",7,12,The New York Times,"[{'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'popup', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2006/07/24/books/leho450.jpg', 'height': 450, 'width': 544, 'legacy': {}, 'subType': 'popup', 'crop_name': 'popup'}, {'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'articleInline', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2006/07/24/books/leho190.jpg', 'height': 157, 'width': 190, 'legacy': {}, 'subType': 'articleInline', 'crop_name': 'articleInline'}, {'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'thumbnail', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2006/07/24/books/leho75.jpg', 'height': 75, 'width': 75, 'legacy': {'thumbnail': 'images/2006/07/24/books/leho75.jpg', 'thumbnailwidth': 75, 'thumbnailheight': 75}, 'subType': 'thumbnail', 'crop_name': 'thumbStandard'}]","[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Sagan, Nick', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Books and Literature', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'ACKROYD, PETER', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}]",2006-07-30T04:00:00+0000,article,BookReview,Books,Review,nyt://article/4e6c63ea-1578-5858-b3c5-6deadeb533ad,1276,nyt://article/4e6c63ea-1578-5858-b3c5-6deadeb533ad,Fiction Chronicle,,,,,,,Reviews by Etelka Lehoczky,"[{'firstname': 'Reviews', 'middlename': 'Etelka', 'lastname': 'Lehoczky', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,dementia,Book Review

By Lisa Moore. (Black Cat, paper, $13.) It's hard to think of a more uncomfortable pleasure -- or maybe a more pleasing discomfort -- than good, strong black comedy. Moore is a Newfoundland writer who brings the pain; her first novel, ""Alligator,"" intertwines several lives in the maritime harbor city of St. John's, and the book's brutal humor may, at its best, put you in mind of Flannery O'Connor. Bad impulses seize each of Moore's beguiling characters: an obsessed filmmaker who ignores ominous cardiopulmonary warnings; her niece, who experiments with petty thievery and politically motivated vandalism; a young hot-dog vendor who feels threatened by the Russian hoodlum living upstairs. ""Alligator"" swerves chaotically among their viewpoints, but Moore's spare, economical writing is full of offhand beauty. Her images are so surefooted they give the impression of having been rendered not merely in the best words available but in the only words imaginable. The nonchalant horror of ""Alligator"" is gripping, too, as when Moore documents a spreading arson fire: ""It traced the invisible ropes of gasoline, it ran down the hallway and into the living room and kitchen and the flames looked like something that had always been there, but had been lying in wait.""",7,20,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'PIERCE, JAMES TODD', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Yu, Charles', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'KOENINGS, N S', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Moore, Lisa', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Shearer, Harry', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'WAGENBRETH, HENNING', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Books and Literature', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'NEWSWORLD (BOOK)', 'rank': 8, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'Alligator (Book)', 'rank': 9, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'NOT ENOUGH INDIANS (BOOK)', 'rank': 10, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'THIRD CLASS SUPERHERO (BOOK)', 'rank': 11, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'BLUE TAXI, THE (BOOK)', 'rank': 12, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL] CRY FOR HELP (BOOK)', 'rank': 13, 'major': 'N'}]",2006-12-31T05:00:00+0000,article,Book Review Desk,Books,Review,nyt://article/0c071c88-3d61-54a0-b9c1-dc90b0244560,1118,nyt://article/0c071c88-3d61-54a0-b9c1-dc90b0244560,Fiction Chronicle,,,Fiction Chronicle,,,,By Todd Pruzan,"[{'firstname': 'Todd', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Pruzan', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,dementia,

By Mark Binelli. (Dalkey Archive Press, paper, $14.95.) The premise of Binelli's first novel is unabashedly kooky. What if Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, the anarchist duo whose execution in 1927 was a catalyst for leftist rage, were actually a slapstick comedy team? This notion may seem arbitrary, even trivializing, but it sets the stage for a sweeping narrative encompassing everything from the struggles of Italian-American immigrants to the social dynamics of pie fights. ""Of course a respectable gentleman did not walk into a party . . . with the objective of setting off a pie fight,"" Sacco muses. His own ""problem, or gift, depending on your perspective, was his realization that everyone possesses some potential for mutiny, however buried."" Jumping around in time, Binelli uses imaginary archival documents -- film magazine interviews, journal entries and other texts -- to depict two comedians, one fat and one thin, who do their time on the vaudeville circuit before graduating to Hollywood vehicles like ""Ventriloquism and Its Discontents"" and the pie-fight classic ""Sacco and Vanzetti Dessert the Cause."" For all their onscreen wackiness, in real life the comedians are habitually stonefaced, as when their neighbor appears at their door inexplicably sporting a beard of bees. ""I see you've got a beard of bees coming along there, huh? What's your story?"" Sacco asks. ""There's really no need for elaboration,"" Vanzetti adds. ""It's clearly difficult for you to speak at the moment, we can tell."" Though Binelli effortlessly captures his characters' competing voices, his thematic connections are often haphazard, and his story doesn't end so much as peter to a halt. But its joyful nostalgia, pinpoint characterizations and postmodern brio more than make up for a weak second reel.",7,12,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'ACKROYD, PETER', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'MEROT, PIERRE', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'BARBERIE, PETER', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'WARE, KATHERINE', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Binelli, Mark', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Sagan, Nick', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Hodgen, Christie', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Books and Literature', 'rank': 8, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'HELLO, I MUST BE GOING (BOOK)', 'rank': 9, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'EVERFREE (BOOK)', 'rank': 10, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'DREAMING IN BLACK AND WHITE (BOOK)', 'rank': 11, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'SACCO AND VANZETTI MUST DIE] (BOOK)', 'rank': 12, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'MAMMALS (BOOK)', 'rank': 13, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'creative_works', 'value': 'LAMBS OF LONDON, THE (BOOK)', 'rank': 14, 'major': 'N'}]",2006-07-30T05:00:00+0000,article,Book Review Desk,Books,Review,nyt://article/e297f4fa-81eb-5c52-8a44-ce01b0707704,1266,nyt://article/e297f4fa-81eb-5c52-8a44-ce01b0707704,Fiction Chronicle,,,Fiction Chronicle,,,,By Etelka Lehoczky,"[{'firstname': 'Etelka', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Lehoczky', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,dementia,
