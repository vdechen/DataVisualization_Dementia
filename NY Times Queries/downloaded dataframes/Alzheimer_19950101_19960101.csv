Dr. Daniel Rader, director of the lipid clinic at the medical center, had ordered a blood test that would reveal whether Ms. Clayton, a 51-year-old resident of Perth Amboy, N.J., had inherited a particular susceptibility to heart attacks. The test showed she had two copies of a gene, called apo E4, which increases the risk of heart disease by 30 percent to 50 percent. While Dr. Rader was telling her this, she mentioned that she was having another problem: her memory was failing her. She had forgotten recent events, she said, and one day she was reading her Bible and found herself unable to decipher words.

The mice seem fine when they are young but, starting in middle age, the areas of the animals' brains involved in learning and memory became riddled with plaque, the characteristic Brillo-like balls of protein that are found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Nerve cells in the mice degenerated in these areas of the brain just as they do in Alzheimer's patients.",https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/09/us/landmark-in-alzheimer-research-breeding-mice-with-the-disease.html,,"After years of false starts, false claims and false hopes, researchers say they have finally produced the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease in laboratory animals.",A,20,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'Lilly, Eli, & Co', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'Athena Neurosciences Inc', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': ""Alzheimer's Disease"", 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Research', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Mice', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}]",1995-02-09T05:00:00+0000,article,National Desk,U.S.,News,nyt://article/1f2f6869-aff7-5fe3-981a-9c5933317bf0,1026,nyt://article/1f2f6869-aff7-5fe3-981a-9c5933317bf0,Landmark in Alzheimer Research: Breeding Mice With the Disease,,,Landmark in Alzheimer Research: Breeding Mice With the Disease,,,,By Gina Kolata,"[{'firstname': 'Gina', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Kolata', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,,Alzheimer

In the catalogue of the show, there is a haunting picture of her at 14. Her face is a delicate oval, her skin is as smooth as silk.

"  Troy Aikman's chin is still discolored, and neurologists crowd around his CAT scan. Concussions are here today, but not necessarily gone tomorrow, which is why Aikman and six other pro quarterbacks convened here today for the most squeamish of seminars.    A panel of doctors was granted an audience this afternoon with Dallas's Aikman, San Francisco's Steve Young and Minnesota's Warren Moon -- to name three -- and, at day's end, there was a recommendation to make concussions a leaguewide headache. Leigh Steinberg, who brainstormed the convention and is the agent for all of the quarterbacks, will submit a proposal to the National Football League's competition committee, and, at the least, he hopes quarterbacks of the future will be treated like punters: gingerly.    Steinberg and his panel of neurologists -- doing much wishful thinking -- will also call for the elimination of artificial turf, a re-evaluation of helmet wear and the inclusion of a sideline medical referee, whose sole job would be to rule on a player's ability to play.    Aikman could easily be the concussion poster boy. He has suffered six in his six-season career, and he can barely recount his most recent Super Bowl. He still wears linebacker Wilber Marshall's fingerprints under his chin -- or helmet prints, to be exact -- and league officials confirmed today there could be rule changes coming that keep quarterbacks upright.    ""How can they possibly help?"" asked Young, the league's reigning most valuable player. ""They're going to make a lineman yell before he hits you?""    According to the league executive Joe Browne, it is conceivable that the league -- at the behest of its subcommittee on concussions -- will expand a quarterback's safety net next season. Under current rules, pass rushers cannot overtly maim a signal caller in the pass pocket, but can club him outside of that realm. That's exactly why Marshall, the Arizona linebacker, was not penalized or fined after he blasted Aikman last season -- because Aikman had roamed from the so-called pocket -- but that rule might be amended at the league meetings in March.    ""It was pretty intense,"" Aikman said today, recalling Marshall's gruesome, helmet-first assault. ""I don't know if I've recovered yet from that thing.""    Post-concussion syndrome was a large topic of discussion today, and doctors on the panel tried to clear up several myths. First, team trainers -- when determining the severity of the blow -- should not ask the player if he can remember the score or what he ate for breakfast. It is more helpful, they said, to examine his ability to concentrate by asking him to recite the months of the year backward. If a player conquers that question and then shows no amnesia in the next 20 minutes, he should be allowed to re-enter the game.    The doctors also warned that many quarterbacks can play deftly despite their concussions -- but may not remember one single touchdown pass. This, in fact, is what happened to Aikman in the playoffs of January 1994. He suffered a concussion in the conference championship against San Francisco and still did not have his complete equilibrium for the ensuing Super Bowl against Buffalo.    ""I said at the time had it been a regular season game, I probably wouldn't have played,"" Aikman said today. ""I was having headaches that week. But, for me, it's the Super Bowl. I know you're saying, 'You're an idiot, a moron for playing.' But, to me, it doesn't matter.    ""I remember playing the game, but not much more. My first Super Bowl, I remember everything that took place at the Rose Bowl, and, to this day, everything's clear. The second one in Atlanta, though, I don't have a clear recollection.""    Doctors today then gave Aikman something else to chew on: concussions make a person more susceptible to Alzheimer's Disease later in life.    ""People this year were asking me, 'When is enough, enough,' "" Aikman said. ""The next one could maybe be my last one. I've said before if it comes to the point that I'm worrying about concussions, I will get out.""    In the interim, most of the quarterbacks today were not scared away from the sport.     ""We can't make it flag football, can we,"" said Washington's John Friesz, who also joined the Rams' Tommy Maddox, Jacksonville's Andre Ware and Cincinnati's David Klingler at the seminar.

"  DIPLOMACY Trade War, the Mini-Series Relax. You can have your Lexuses. The United States and Japan brought their tariff-rattling spat to a close last week with a predictably dramatic 11th-hour deal. But this mini-drama somehow left viewers unsatisfied: weak tea when strong coffee had been promised. With portentous huffing and puffing, the Administration had vowed, in Phil Gramm's words, ""a gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" -- nothing less than a historic cracking-open of Japan's notoriously sealed markets. But the agreement that emerged was deliberately ambiguous: no specific Japanese commitments on opening its markets, nothing enforceable. As one American trade expert put it, ""We talk loudly and carry a tiny stick."" LAWSUITS Now, Let Investors Beware The flood of legislation that's swamping this nation is clearly a mess, and many people, in response, indulge in an age-old reflex: blame the lawyers. That reflex is surely behind the drive to discourage shareholder lawsuits -- a battle that has inundated innocent civilians lately with a barrage of advertising. Brokers and accountants, emboldened by the Republicans strutting their stuff, have pushed for a law to limit lawsuits, saying many suits are frivolous. Consumer groups have countered with ads cautioning that small investors would be left with little recourse if they were duped. But anti-lawyer fever is clearly strong these Republican days, and last week the Senate approved the measure with a veto-proof 70-29 vote.  INSIDER TRADING Too Tempting to Resist If the money's lying there, they will take it -- whether it's theirs or not. That seemed to be the lesson last week when a former Cravath, Swaine & Moore senior associate, and his brother, pleaded guilty to insider trading. There is a lot of money lying around these days -- in the form of advance information about the current flurry of mergers. And cases of insider trading are growing in tandem. Until now Cravath had prided itself on keeping its nose clean, but this lawyer passed on information that resulted in trading profits of nearly $1 million. Now you'd think that someone who'd reached such professional heights had it made (if by ""it"" you mean money), but the siren song was clearly too loud.  MUNICIPAL FINANCE A County Circles Its Oranges A lot of people are against taxes, but Orange County voters surely take the prize. Last week they refused to approve a mere half-percent emergency sales tax increase, even though this defiant stand nudged them toward a rather messy abyss. The county's in bankruptcy, its debt is now in default, a state takeover looms, and it's far from clear how the trash will be collected and the students taught. Couldn't the county issue more bonds to make it all better? Right. A fellow here has a nice bridge to sell to those bond buyers. And perhaps worse, municipal bonds all over the place have gotten a black eye.  HEALTH CARE The H.M.O. Giant Is Coming H.M.O.'s are coming. Yes, yes, they've been here for some time, but now they'll really be a force to reckon with. Last week United Healthcare, an H.M.O. giant based in Minnesota, agreed to buy Metrahealth, a more traditional insurer. Metrahealth, carved recently out of the Met Life and Travelers health businesses, has 10 million customers, including 1.5 million in the New York area. The merger with United Healthcare will create the nation's largest health-plan company. So if H.M.O.'s have always seemed a distant concept -- somewhere else, affecting someone else -- that is sure to change in a hurry.  TOBACCO Keeping Minors From Smoking Let's see. Philip Morris wants to sell cigarettes -- that's its business. And most smokers start when they are teen-agers. Yet last week the company said it would go all out to keep minors from smoking. (Well, not exactly all out: the plan will cost $5 million; 1994 profits were $4.7 billion.) Highlights of the program are a national ad campaign, warnings that say ""Underage Sale Prohibited,"" and the end of promotional giveaways. What this means (choose one): a) Philip Morris, in a stunning about-face, actually wants fewer people to smoke, or b) ""They are scared,"" as an American Heart Association spokesman said, and want to undercut efforts to regulate tobacco as a drug and head off state efforts to clamp down on sales to minors.  CORPORATE DIRECTORS Part Time. High Pay. Perks. Do directors earn their often-substantial pay? With corporate austerity all the rage, many shareholders (whose jobs, perhaps, were devoured by that omnivorous austerity) have been asking just that. So Graef Crystal, a pay guru who clearly relishes tackling such questions, took a look. In a report out last week, he found a huge range in 1994 board pay, from $3,600 at Berkshire Hathaway to $180,700 at Roadway Services -- or, as he put it more tersely, ""It's a mess."" He created a formula for defining how much is too much, and in what was surely a string of amazing coincidences, he found many companies at which both directors and chief executives -- who scratch each other's wallets -- were significantly overpaid.  WORKPLACE The 24-Hour-a-Day Fast Track It's easy to fantasize about a $1 million-plus salary, the freedom from worry (No more credit-card interest!) the money would bestow. But such a salary could be a thief of freedom, too. If you worked, say, for Ronald Perelman, you might be on call morning and night, weekday and weekend. That was fine with Fred Tepperman -- until his wife got Alzheimer's. Then he needed more time at home, and soon lost his job as Mr. Perelman's chief financial officer. The company said he ""willfully failed to devote to his employer his entire time, energy and skill,"" while Mr. Tepperman insists it was no more than missing a few breakfast meetings to care for his wife. The courts will now decide who's right, for Mr. Tepperman has sued for more than $25 million in damages.  TAKEOVERS How Does It Feel, Mr. Pickens? Takeover artists -- they're almost-mythic corporate rough riders, swooping in on pot-bellied managers, kicking them with their studded boots, and snarling, ""Get with it or get out!"" Such raiders, a breed apart, would surely never be on the receiving end of those kicks. Or would they? One fabled marauder of the wild 80's was one T. Boone Pickens -- the very name conjures images of a man who eats rusty nails with his steak. But sure enough, last week two big investors took aim at Mr. Pickens's natural gas company, Mesa, chanting the old raiders' chant: ""Enhance shareholder value."" And suddenly it was Mr. Pickens with his back to the saloon wall, for one of those investors is none other than Marvin Davis, the California billionaire.",https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/02/business/diary-295495.html,,"DIPLOMACY Trade War, the Mini-Series Relax.

"Q. It cost a small fortune to give my father the funeral he always wanted, but I don't want to spend more than what's absolutely necessary on my own. What's the cheapest way to go?
SHIRLEY LINDEMANN
Pendleton, N.Y. 
A. It depends on how much posthumous guilt you're willing to take with you into eternity. If you care nothing about the feelings of your friends or family, surely the most frugal approach is to become a street person and carry no personal identification. Then, when your body is found and nobody comes to claim it at the morgue, you're almost assured a numbered grave in the potter's fields on Hart Island overlooking Long Island Sound.

If you're like most people, though, you will agree that the funeral isn't for the dead, but for the living. It may not matter to you, but to your friends and family, the ritual can provide closure. So live a little! It's definitely possible to arrange for a cost-conscious yet satisfying departure.

""Checking out"" can be big business -- an estimated $6 billion annually -- for the more than 45,000 Americans who operate the nation's 22,000 or so funeral homes. A moderate send-off, including funeral, flowers, limo and burial permit, can easily run $10,000 or more -- cemetery plot, opening and closing of the grave and monument considerably extra.

For those who have not put children through college, a funeral with all its trimmings can easily turn into the third-largest purchase -- after the house and family car.

The expensive bon voyage is certainly available for those who want that sort of thing -- a luxurious cast bronze coffin with a glass dome cover will set you back $85,000.

Some funerals I've attended probably cost more than a wedding at the Plaza Hotel and were definitely crowd pleasers. When Harry Cohn, the despised Columbia Pictures studio boss, went to his final screening at Forest Lawn Memorial Park back in 1958, all the Hollywood establishment, including his most bitter enemies, showed up.

Surveying the hordes of ill-wishers, the writer and director Billy Wilder whispered, ""This just proves the old show-biz adage that if you give the public what it wants to see, you can always count on a big turnout.""

Outside the Hollywood mogul set, lower-key final exits are in demand. Since Jessica Mitford wrote an expose called ""The American Way of Death"" more than 30 years ago, the Federal Trade Commission has done a credible job of cracking down on abuses in the funeral industry. A 1984 law requires funeral providers to tell clients in advance the cost of their services as well as the ones not required by state or local law.

Even so, one must be alert. According to the National Coalition for Fair Funeral Prices, many mortuaries and predeath plans (think of it as a sort of Christmas Club without half-off shopping) overcharge by as much as $3,000 a funeral.

The first step is to do some planning. Bear in mind that if you don't, your family will probably spend more money from your estate to show their love and respect. The emotional trauma, time pressure and lack of information put consumers at an enormous disadvantage in making funeral arrangements, cautions the Federal Trade Commission. Whatever you decide, inform your family and relieve them of the difficult decisions about brief or perpetual care.

Cost-efficient alternatives to the big blowout and expensive cemetery plot are several. You can join a nonprofit memorial or burial society, arrange for burial at sea, select cremation or even donate your body to medical science.

Memorial and burial societies are, in effect, buying co-operatives that trade in funerals -- instead of groceries -- in bulk. Wielding considerable buying power, such societies can be found in 175 of North America's largest markets, with most charging annual membership fees of $15 to $30. Typically, they negotiate agreements with local undertakers, specifying the desired cost and type of disposition preferred (burial, cremation).

Memorial societies are independent of funeral homes and advise members to use caution about any prepayment plan. Regrettably, there are unscrupulous operators in every service industry, particularly those that trade on other people's misery. So if someone from a society tries to sell you something or offers a prepayment plan, investigate carefully, warns Ernest Morgan, author of ""Dealing Creatively with Death"" (Zinn Communications, $12.95). 

According to John Blake, executive director of the Funeral and Memorial Societies of America Inc., a preplanned funeral from one of these groups can save you up to 75 percent.

In many cases, members with simple desires -- no silk-lined coffins or symphony orchestras -- have paid less than $1,000.  ""About 90 percent of our members,"" Mr. Blake says, ""opt for a cremation and memorial service rather than the more costly funeral home service and burial.""

Me? I've always fancied a Viking-like send-off, complete with the flaming long boat heading into the sunset, like the one in Blake Edwards's 1981 movie, ""S.O.B."" Too many weekend sailors, though, must have complained to the Coast Guard about surface clutter to keep the practice from catching on.

Still, the Neptune Society in Medford on Long Island will take your remains and scatter them in the ocean for the low, low cost of $100.  A more formal service, on a boat out of Freeport, L.I., that accommodates 50 friends and clergy, is available for $575. Disseminations, as Neptune calls them, are usually done at the end of the month, said Joan Kiernan, a spokeswoman, ""and the family will receive a certificate showing latitude and longitude in the Atlantic.""

For do-it-yourselfers who prowl Home Depot on the weekends, 43 states permit families to take charge of their own dead. Since this makes for a personalized and unique funeral experience, it can be meaningful for survivors as well as economical. You can even build your own coffin.

Before you run to the backyard and select a shady corner, check out local health regulations. You will probably find a slew of rules that make a home funeral difficult or impossible. Most towns outlaw home interment (though authorities have been known to look the other way if you're only burying an urn full of ashes).

A charitable and cost-effective route is to deed your body to a medical school for training future doctors or to donate specific organs for transplants. The administrative and transportation cost to the family or estate is negligible; the benefits incalculable.

As of 1994, according to the American Council on Transplantation, the waiting list for available hearts, kidneys, lungs, livers, limbs, eyes and other body parts stood at over 33,000 desperate patients. Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons has produced an information packet for advance applicants and will even arrange for free pickup and delivery within a 150-mile radius of Manhattan.

Should you leave your body to science, you must make a backup plan. While the spirit may be willing, you see, the flesh may no longer be in shape. The only exception: donating your gray matter to the Harvard Medical School for their McLean Hospital brain bank, a primary source for researchers working on Alzheimer's and various brain disorders.

Definitely not for penny pinchers is flash freezing the body in hopes that your body can be thawed and restored to life once a cure is developed for whatever is killing you.

Walt Disney seriously considered such a second act but was talked out of it by the time he died of cancer in 1966. The American Cryonics Society will suspend your body in liquid nitrogen for $125,000. Budget watchers, suggests the society's president, may want to consider freezing just the brain for a mere $15,000.
