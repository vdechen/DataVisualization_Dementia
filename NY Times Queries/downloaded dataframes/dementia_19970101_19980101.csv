Platform shoes, which swept Europe and America in the 1940's, and bell-bottom pants, which first appeared in 1965, are believed to be caused by viruses that mutate and periodically come back. No generation, it seems, is exempt, although those who have contracted the diseases and survived (neither is known to be fatal) are evidently immune to subsequent outbreaks. ''Ugh, platform shoes,'' mothers could be heard telling their daughters in the 70's. ''I wore those in the 40's. I never have to wear them again.''
