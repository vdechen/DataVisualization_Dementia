"GEARHART-Robert Paul, M.D. An attending physician at Lenox Hill Hospital for forty-five years, he died on December 27th, 2000 at the Piedmont Retirement Center in Thomasville, N.C. He was 88 years old. Golda, his wife of 60 years, was at his side. Born in Montoursville, PA., he received a degree in Business Administration from the University of Pittsburgh, before graduating from Temple Medical School in 1939. He interned at Saint Vincent's Hospital in Erie, PA. He then served as Chief Resident at newly opened Triboro Hospital in New York City, before joining the staff at Lenox Hill in 1943. In 1948, he was appointed to the teaching faculty and was named Chief of Pulmonary Medicine in 1964. He served for many years as Chief of the Nursing Health Service and Chief of the Employee Health Service, which were ultimately combined under his direction. With little interest in hospital politics and business, Dr. Gearhart turned down several high-profile opportunities during his career. He much preferred to lead rounds with residents, to brighten the hospital with his spirit and humor, and to dedicate himself to his patients and practice. He retired in 1988. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his daughter Susan, and her children Shane and Erin; son Robert, Jr. and his daughter Erin; and son Reid. A memorial service will be held January 13 at the Piedmont Retirement Center (336-474-3804). Donations to the Alzheimer's Association or charity of choice.

" The Orchid Thief   By Susan Orlean. Ballantine, $14.    The author's first book-length narrative is a journalistic account of a thief caught pilfering 200 rare orchids and plants in Florida, but its true subject is the monomania of collectors and growers, who can wait seven years just to see a new plant bloom. This peculiar mania is revealed as ''a small thing of grandeur, a passion with a pedigree,'' Ted Conover wrote here last year.    The Hours   By Michael Cunningham. Picador USA, $13.    The theme of this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is the haunting of present lives by memories and books, and it evolves in three connected narratives: that of a New York woman whose life echoes events in Virginia Woolf's ''Mrs. Dalloway''; a housewife in 1940's Los Angeles who reads the book; and Woolf herself in 1923, living near London and writing her novel. ''The overall impression is that of a delicate, triumphant glance, an acknowledgment of Woolf that takes her into Cunningham's own territory, a place of late-century danger but also of treasurable hours,'' Michael Wood wrote in these pages in 1998.    Rocket Boys: A Memoir   By Homer H. Hickam Jr. Delta, $12.95.    This nostalgic coming-of-age story is set during the Sputnik era in dreary West Virginia coal country, where the author (a future NASA engineer) and five pals undertook an audacious series of rocket launchings that captured the imagination of a dying region. ''He is a very adept storyteller,'' James R. Gaines wrote here in 1998.    Bad Chemistry   By Gary Krist. Berkley, $7.50.    A headless body, a combustible dog and ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit'' are among the plot elements in this taut mystery about an ex-policewoman trying to track down her missing husband. ''Fascination with the power of secrets . . . holds the book together,'' David Willis McCullough wrote in these pages in 1998.    Inventing Wyatt Earp: His Life and Many Legends   By Allen Barra. Carroll & Graf, $15.95.    In 1881, a 30-second gunfight helped create an American hero and a stirring myth of frontier justice. It turns out that accounts of Earp's career and the shootout were full of ironies, confusion and outright falsehoods. This ''refreshingly pugnacious book'' aims to set the record straight, Richard E. Nicholls said here last year.    Elegy for Iris   By John Bayley. Picador USA, $13.    The British literary critic chronicles his long, rich relationship with his wife, the novelist Iris Murdoch, and her descent into Alzheimer's disease. ''In its evocation of the lyrical, the comic and the tragic, this splendid book enlarges our imagination of the range and possibilities of love,'' Mary Gordon wrote here in 1998.    There Once Was a World:   A Nine-Hundred-Year Chronicle of the Shtetl of Eishyshok   By Yaffa Eliach. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $25.    A historian recreates in intensely rendered detail the daily rhythms of life in her family's shtetl, a town in what is now Lithuania whose 3,500 Jews were nearly all murdered. Her account contains numerous photographs and interviews with survivors. In 1998 our reviewer, Stephen J. Dubner, called this ''an exhaustive and kaleidoscopic history.'' ''The Rest of Us'': The Rise of America's Eastern European Jews, by Stephen Birmingham (Syracuse University, $22.95), is the final installment in the author's trilogy on Jewish immigrants in America. It is a broad canvas filled with portraits of colorful characters like Irving Berlin, Meyer Lansky and Ralph Lauren. ''Trenchant observations permeate this book,'' Sydney Zion wrote here in 1984.    Face-Time   By Erik Tarloff. Pocket Books, $12.95.    A rising White House speechwriter is horrified when the president takes a shine to his girlfriend. She's flattered, of course, and tempted by the prospect of ultimate insider access. The result is a novel ''about sex and power in Washington that goes behind the headlines to a darker place,'' Patricia O'Brien wrote here last year.    Falling Slowly   By Anita Brookner. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.    This novel focuses on two willfully hermitic sisters torn between a desire for connection with the larger world and a greedy complacency about their carefully sheltered existence. Brookner is ''the unrivaled mistress of the stifled life,'' Claire Messud wrote here last year.    Foreign Bodies   By Hwee Hwee Tan.   Washington Square/Pocket Books, $12.95.    This first novel is about a young lawyer in Singapore who has nine days to prove that her English boyfriend is not the mastermind of an international gambling ring. ''Tan spins out a gripping story,'' Anderson Tepper wrote in the Book Review last year.    Winter Count   By Barry Lopez. Vintage, $11.    Many of these stories focus on obscure figures and incidents in the Plains and Rockies, and are informed by American Indian culture and mystical wisdom. Each tale ''is as economical in design, as painstakingly crafted and as resonant as a good classical guitar,'' David Quammen wrote here in 1981.

" THE REFORM PARTY    BUCHANAN RESIGNATION SOUGHT  Reform Party leaders in Colorado and Georgia have called on Pat Buchanan, the leading contender for the Reform presidential nomination, to resign from the party on the grounds that he has been spreading hate and intolerance and ignoring the party procedures. At a meeting last Saturday, the executive committee of the party in Colorado passed a resolution saying that Mr. Buchanan was ''promoting discrimination, intolerance and hatred against various groups of law-abiding American citizens.'' In addition, it condemned remarks attributed to Mr. Buchanan in which homosexuality was called a disorder. ''We just don't have any room for intolerance,'' Victor Good, the party chairman, said. The Reform Party in Georgia called for Mr. Buchanan's resignation after he invited state residents to a May 21 state convention that party leaders said was scheduled illegally. Jim Mangia, secretary of the national Reform Party, predicted that more states would move against Mr. Buchanan. Bay Buchanan, Mr. Buchanan's sister and chief strategist, called the Colorado and Georgia moves ''much ado about nothing.''

When the final stages of mapping the human genome were hyped last month, both President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair called for a swift, extensive ban on using genetic information to discriminate in employment or insurance. Clinton had already signed an executive order back in February, banning such discrimination for federal employees. True to form, both politicians had polling data to support them. A 1998 survey of 1,000 randomly selected Americans found that 63 percent of them balked at any genetic testing if an employer or health insurer could have access to the data.
