"With enough resolved crises under its belt to make a daytime soap envious, ""Sisters"" comes to a close in a special two-hour episode tonight. The NBC series had its premiere in the spring of 1991 and, the network says, has steadily maintained a loyal audience, especially among women in the important demographic category of ages 18 to 49. Never a blockbuster hit, ""Sisters"" managed to hold its own nicely, despite the frequent liability of weak lead-in shows.         The series, created by Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman, offered strong female characters who were awash in a sea of troubles and who deftly reduced any male in the vicinity to a supporting role. In the first episode, the four Reed sisters reunited to help their mother, Bea (Elizabeth Hoffman), get back on her  feet after the death of their father. The sisters would meet regularly in a steam room to dish and connive and giggle. Initially, the dialogue was edgy, especially as far as Alex (Swoosie Kurtz), the oldest, was concerned. As an aspiring socialite and obsessive shopper, Alex was a font of wisecracks and dizzy advice.

"After a worldwide search for families with a rare inherited disorder, scientists have discovered for the first time a gene that affects aging in humans. The gene, which was identified among families in Japan and Syria, may shed light on the process of normal aging.         People with the disorder, known as Werner's syndrome, begin to grow gray hair as teen-agers. Though of average height as grade schoolers, they may often find themselves among the shortest students in high school since they fail to get the usual adolescent growth spurt. In their 20's, they can expect to develop the ills of old age -- cataracts, wrinkled skin and thinning of the bones. Most    individuals die from heart attacks or cancer in their 40's.
