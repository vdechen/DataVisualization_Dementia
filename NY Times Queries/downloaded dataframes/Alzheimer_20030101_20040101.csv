"CARLIN-Steve, 84. Died Tuesday, February 4, 2003 of the effects of Alzheimer's. Born in Brooklyn, the son of Russian immigrants, Steve was a brilliant, quiet, poetic man. His wife Peggy and his daughter Melissa loved him dearly and mourn his loss. He is survived by his brother Morty and his sisters Rose and Mabel. A television pioneer, Steve was in the forefront of television since its inception. Steve produced 19 television shows in the United States and six in Europe, including a children's program entitled ''Rootie Kazootie'', ''The $64,000 Question'' and ''Science All Stars'' which garnered an Emmy Nomination. ''Science All Stars'', was one of Steve's favorites; young people from 12 to 17 presented their scientific achievements. President Kennedy encouraged the endeavor on the first show, which also featured Colonel Chuck Jaeger, the first pilot to break through the sound barrier. In Italy, he created the first non-governmental TV show ''M'ama, Non M'ama'' (Love Me, Love Me Not) which was Number 1 on Italian Television for three years. In addition to the television shows, he also produced children's record albums for RCA Victor, featuring stars such as Joan Crawford, Jimmy Stewart, Danny Kaye, et al. ''Rootie Kazootie'', a TV favorite with children for several years, also became a series of Golden Books, distributed throughout the U.S. and Europe. Steve also wrote a Comic Strip, with artist Myron Waldman, entitled ''Happy the Humbug'' which appeared every Sunday for about 5 years as a full color page in newspapers all over the country. His many, good friends in the U.S. and Europe will miss Steve's understated humor, his wise observations and his devoted friendship. His beloved wife of 56 years, Peggy and daughter Melissa, missed him every day as Alzheimer's took him further and further away. They are bereft.

"MECHANIC - Dr. Mayer, D.D.S. The ''Mayer'' of HoHo-Kus. Although he was a man of prodigious energy who was hardly sick a day in his life, Mayer Mechanic, D.D.S., died on Saturday, January 4, 2003, of complications from a sudden stroke. He was 85 years old. He attended University of Michigan, where he graduated with honors. He went on to do the same at Temple University Dental School, where he received a special award for pediatric dentistry. He served two years as a dentist in the US Navy during WWII. Dr. Mechanic was a third generation Patersonian, whose grandfather, Cantor Jacob Landman, founded the first Jewish cemetery in the Silk City. However after practicing dentistry in his hometown of Paterson for over twenty years, Dr. Mechanic moved his home and dental practice to Ho-Ho-Kus. There, while shifting his reputation as the gentlest dentist in Passaic County to the gentlest dentist in Bergen County, he also caught the real estate bug. He began moonlighting from dentistry with his wife Bernadine, who was also moonlighting from her automotive parts business. Together they formed a joint partnership called Maybern Realty and went from their first project of renovating a defunct supermarket into an IBM headquarters to building many other office buildings and retail centers in Ho-Ho-Kus and surrounding towns. Dr. Mechanic earned a reputation as a great landlord by treating his tenants more as friends than tenants. He would always pick up his rental checks personally, just for the opportunity to chat with his tenants, since he was ever interested in people and their businesses. He was also a famous storyteller and would regale everyone with wonderful stories about his own life and colorful stories about the depression era. In fact, he knew so many people in town from his years as a dentist, realtor and member of the Ho-Ho-Kus Chamber of Commerce that many people fondly referred to him as the ''Mayer of Ho-Ho-Kus''something he always joked about with the real Mayor, Rusty Thompson. Dr. Mechanic is survived by his beloved wife of 59 years, Bernadine Mechanic, and by his three children: Leslie, Jonathan and Louis. He is also survived by six grandchildren: Max, Suzanne, Karen, Marc, Adam and Ross. The family requests that any doantions be sent to: The Alzheimer's Association, 919 N.

Many have adult children living far away, while others have no family at all. I am often called upon to put necessary services into place and to supervise each client's care. Often I enter a client's home and find I am eyed with suspicion or presented with the conviction that all is fine and my services are unnecessary. It then becomes a challenge for me to develop a relationship with each client so that we can work together give life quality and meaning. Such relationships are not one sided because I have found that in the process of giving, much is received.

"ESTESS--Jenifer. The Estess family and the entire Project A.L.S. organization and friends are mourning the loss of Jenifer Estess. Jenifer passed away on Tuesday morning, December 16, 2003 in her home, after a long and courageous struggle with ALS. Jenifer fought this disease, as she lived her life, with dignity and courage. She was an inspiration to all who knew her and countless others who were afflicted with ALS and other neurological disorders. Jenifer's dream was that, someday, there would be a cure for ALS and the related diseases of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's. She devoted her energy to making that dream a reality. She knew that progress in finding a cure would take years and would likely come too late for her. Her wish was that Project A.L.S. would go on and that all of us would fight this disease for years to come until a cure is found. To the thousands of Project A.L.S. supporters, we pledge to honor Jenifer by continuing the fight to find a cure for this dreaded disease.

Jenifer's tireless and creative efforts, accomplished while battling ALS, have contributed greatly to research funding and to raising public awareness of the disease. It is with special pride that the Association's National Office joins the greater New York Chapter in saluting Jenifer's extraordinary courage. Her superb leadership along with her sisters Valerie, Meredith and Alison, and friend Julianne, has left a major legacy in the search for a cure for ALS. The path Jenifer chose in mobilizing the entertainment industry and other influential individuals to find the cure and treatments of ALS serves as an inspirational model for people with ALS and the entire ALS community. The ALS association is committed to the mission that Jenifer embraced and believes that her efforts on behalf of those with this disease will be carried forward with perserverance and dedication.

All the evidence points to the New Druids, an anti-Christian, neo-pagan group of zealots who promote ancestor worship and maybe do a little drug dealing on the side.

"McDONALD'S PLANS TO CLOSE MORE RESTAURANTS McDonald's said yesterday that it would close more underperforming restaurants in the United States and Japan. It did not say how many. The company also said it would retain its $1 Value Menu, which has increased business but decreased profit margins. James J. Cantalupo, the new chief executive, said that drastic changes at the company were not necessary but that small modifications like keeping restrooms cleaner and providing customer service were. Mr. Cantalupo also said that McDonald's would not provide quarterly earnings forecasts in 2003, but would focus on the long-term goal of rebuilding its business. In December, the company warned that it would not meet earnings expectations and would close 175 lagging restaurants. Sherri Day (NYT) LANDS' END APPAREL GAVE SEARS A LIFT IN FOURTH QUARTER Initial success with sales of its Lands' End apparel helped Sears, Roebuck to a fourth-quarter profit despite problems in its credit card unit. The company's net income rose 72 percent, although most of that was because of a one-time tax gain. Excluding noncomparable items, its income climbed 1.8 percent from the previous year. Operating income in the fourth quarter declined 15 percent from the previous year, as Sears increased its allowance for uncollectible credit card accounts by $150 million. Sears said that decline was offset by 10 percent higher operating income in its retail business, helped by improvements in margin and the acquisition of Lands' End last spring. (AP) FEDERATED TO CLOSE 11 STORES AND CUT 2,000 JOBS Federated Department Stores plans to close 11 stores and cut nearly 2,000 jobs this year, as it expects flat sales and earnings in 2003.

I was visiting her at a nursing home called Cromwell's, in the same Yorkshire village where she'd lived for forty years. For most of my childhood, Cromwell's had been the Manor House Hotel, a business that failed to prosper no matter how often it changed hands. She hated the greystone gauntness of the building, and when it became a nursing home said she'd rather take an overdose than `end up there'. In the event, when she became too ill to manage at home, it seemed the only sensible option. She resented the indignity but accepted the logic. Friends and neighbours could drop by.

A millionaire and philanthropist named Archibald brought a dozen or so over from Kenya around the turn of the century and kept them in an aviary built against the side of his house. A few days before his death, in a moment more notable for generosity than good sense, he swung open the cage and released the birds into a wide summer sky. According to eyewitness reports, the parrots made a dazed circle beneath the clouds, surprised by their sudden freedom, and, not immediately seeing anything more to their liking, lighted amid the branches of an apple orchard on the back acreage of Archibald's property. There, as is the habit of nature, they flourished and have continued to thrive for more than ninety years. But in September, when winter creeps in from the ocean and cold air kindles hazy instincts, the parrots flee south for warmer climes and settle here, in Elbow, Alabama, along a slow bend in the Black Warrior River, where perhaps they are reminded of waters, slower still, in an almost forgotten continent across the sea.
