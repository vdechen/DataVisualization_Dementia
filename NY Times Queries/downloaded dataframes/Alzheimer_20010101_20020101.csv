"BURNS-Ethel Dagaberta Holland Cherry (nee Bransome) born February 4, 1911 to Emil and Isabelle Bransome after a long courageous battle with Alzheimers disease passed into glory on Sunday, September 30 at 1:02 PM. The death of her father forced her to leave school at 14 to support her mother and 3 brothers, continuing to sustain them all throughout their lives. She had a beautiful voice and sang in the choir of Temple Beth-El in Bradley Beach, NJ. In the 1940's she had three high fashion stores in Miami Beach, FL. carrying haute couture in sportswear and evening clothes. In 1947 she was lauded by Women's Wear Daily as The Small Business Woman of the Year. After Mr. Cherry's death she closed the stores and opened a Barton's candy store in what is now the Bal Harbor shops in Miami Beach, FL. In the 1970's she went to work for a fledgling bridal designer in NYC & built the business from nothing to success. After working 5-1/2 days a week for 26 years she ended her career at the age of 85 when she decided that Alzheimer's disease was robbing her of the things she needed to work: memory & spatial logistics. She was a paragon, the epitome of everything generous and gracious, giving of herself unstintingly to anyone who crossed her path. She graced our lives with compassion, strength and boundless love.

Bobbie was a student in Hanya Holm's first dance class in the United States, and was an early modern dance enthusiast thanks to her avant-garde mother. She danced and performed under the direction of Margaret Dobler at the University of Wisconsin. Bobbie was a fine student and graduated from UW in 1941.

From that day in September 1938, when Bobbie and Bob met at the AEPhi Sorority tea, at the University of Wisconsin, it was a continuing love affair. They eloped to Dubuque, Iowa on May 4, 1940. As a new mother during World War II, Bobbie suffered the worry of separation from her husband. Shaped by her happy childhood in the Jewish community in Paterson, NJ, she maintained a lifelong bond to that place and those people. In Hillsdale, NJ, where Bobbie and her family resided for 45 years, she was active in many community activities including drama, fund-raising for many causes, and ardent support for the Bergen YJCC and Temple Emanuel. She regarded the growth and popularity of both these institutions as miraculous. Bobbie and Bob sponsored the immigration of the Raiskin family from Russia.

She was a vibrant and passionate woman who frequently devoted her efforts to political and educational campaigns. She loved sports and enjoyed competing and developing her skills. Bobbie was a student in Hanya Holm's first dance class in the United States, and was an early modern dance enthusiast thanks to her avant-garde mother. She danced and performed under the direction of Margaret Dobler at the University of Wisconsin. Bobbie was a fine student and graduated from UW in 1941.

From that day in September 1938, when Bobbie and Bob met at the AEPhi Sorority tea, at the University of Wisconsin, it was a continuing love affair. They eloped to Dubuque, Iowa on May 4, 1940. As a new mother during World War II, Bobbie suffered the worry of separation from her husband. Shaped by her happy childhood in the Jewish community in Paterson, NJ, she maintained a lifelong bond to that place and those people. In Hillsdale, NJ, where Bobbie and her family resided for 45 years, she was active in many community activities including drama, fund-raising for many causes, and ardent support for the Bergen YJCC and Temple Emanuel.

" Trump Begins Negotiations On $1.3 Billion in Bond Debt  Donald J. Trump has begun talks with bondholders to adjust the terms of $1.3 billion in debt and is now expected to pay $73 million in interest past due on those bonds within days, a lawyer for Mr. Trump said.    Mr. Trump announced the day before the interest was due that he would not make the payment, even though he had the cash to do so. Some bondholders considered the missed payment a negotiating tactic by Mr. Trump, who could use a decline in the securities to put pressure on them to come to the table. [Page C2.]    No Decision From Russia on Oil Cuts  Russia sent mixed signals on whether it would cooperate with other oil exporters outside OPEC in cutting back production, causing prices to fall. In New York, crude oil for January delivery fell 19 cents, to $18.96 a barrel. It rose 72 cents a barrel on Tuesday when Mexico and Norway, the No. 2 and No. 3 non-OPEC exporters after Russia, agreed to make much larger cuts if Russia would do the same.

Loving and beloved wife of Eugene Kleiner for 54 years, mother of Robert Kleiner and Lisa Kleiner Chanoff, grandmother of Jake Kleiner and Yael, Talia and Eli Chanoff, and sister of Bruno Wassertheil. Rose was born in 1925 in Katowice, Poland. In the fall of 1939 her family set out across the Atlantic for the New York World's Fair. While they were en route, Germany invaded Poland, and Rose and her family were suddenly emigres. They settled in Manhattan. Rose graduated from Brooklyn College in 1946, and served as a social worker at Quaker House. In 1947 Rose married Eugene Kleiner, an engineering student at Polytechnic University and also an emigre from Europe. In 1952 their first child, Robert, was born. In 1956 the family moved to California where Eugene was one of a group assembled by Willliam Schockley to produce the transistor. In 1959 their second child, Lisa, was born. Rose put her lifelong passion for social work on hold to devote her considerable energy and talent to raising her family. She created a house of abundance, filled with delicious food, music, laughter and fun. She sang in madrigal and jazz singing groups, and moved two pianos into her living room to play duets with her daughter Lisa. At age 49, after raising her two children, Rose returned to school and earned a master's degree in gerontology at Berkeley's School of Social Welfare. She became the first program director of the Senior Coordinating Council's Senior Day Health program. In 1982, Rose founded Older Adults Care Management (OACM), a pioneer in designing support plans, training companions, and providing support services for the elderly. Rose merged OACM with The Goldman Institute in 2000. As a community leader, Rose was a thoughtful and unstoppable force for good. She served on the boards of El Camino Hospital Foundation, the Career Action Center, the International Tremor Foundation, The Parkinson's Institute, Respite & Research for Alzheimer's Disease, the U.C. Berkeley Center for Aging Research, the International Longevity Center and the Goldman Institute, and was a member of the Citizen's Advisory Committee at Duke University Council on Aging & Human Development and of the Geriatric Advisory Council of Mt. Sinai Medical Center, NY. She was honored with a Woman of Vision award from the Career Action Center, an Athena award from the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce, and the Adele Elkind award from the National Association of Professional Geriatric Care Managers. In 1988 she received a Lifetime of Achievement Award from the Senior Coordinating Council of Palo Alto. Rose was a positive thinking woman of action. She was enormously generous with gifts, spirit and love. She loved to take care of people and to make them happy. She always found the good in people and situations, and never spoke badly about another human being. She was wise, innovative, had a great sense of humor, a great sense of style and was completely original. She loved life and was adored by her family, friends and colleagues. She was and will continue to be an inspiration to everyone who knew her.

" NEW YORK    BROOKLYN: WOMAN FOUND DEAD IN PARKING LOT  An 85-year-old woman searching for her deaf husband was found curled up in a Brooklyn parking lot yesterday morning, the police said. The woman, Angelina Mafredimi, who had Alzheimer's disease, was pronounced dead at Kings Highway Medical Center, they said. Her husband, Giovanni, 87, was found in the afternoon standing at a bus stop near the Kings Plaza shopping center. He had left his Gerritsen Beach home Thursday without saying where he was going. The police said that it was not uncommon for him to disappear for days, but that he had always managed to find his way home. Sunday night, however, his wife went looking for him.

"McCAFFREY-James J., 79. Of Blue Hill, ME, a retired advertising agency executive, former weekly newspaper publisher and avid fisherman-not necessarily in that order-died Saturday, July 21, at the Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor of complications from a stroke. He was stricken a month earlier while on a fishing trip to Canada. Jim was born in New York City on May 15, 1922, the son of John and Marie McCaffrey of Scarsdale, N.Y. He was educated at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., & was enrolled at Princeton University when he as stricken with polio at the age of 19. Despite surviving with only limited mobility in his left leg and none at all in his right, McCaffrey nevertheless completed his education at Princeton, graduating with honors in 1944, and was headed for law school at Harvard University when he took a summer job in the mailroom of Young and Rubicam, then the second largest advertising agency in the world. He was bitten by the advertising bug and told Harvard ''the law will have to do without me.'' In 1945, Jim met a young woman named Virginia (''Geegee'') Given on the beach of Fire Island and the two were marrid the following year. While she continued working as an editor for ''Glamour Magazine'' and ''House Garden Magazine'', he quickly worked his way up the advertising ladder to become an account executive, first at Young and Rubicam and then at Ogilvy and Mather. In 1962, he joined forces with David B. McCall to purchase an agency called C.J. LaRoche and Co. Thus was born the firm of McCaffrey and McCall, Inc. The company became one of New York's preeminent advertising agencies over the next two decades. Over his career, Jim worked with such clients as Rolls Royce, J.C. Penney, Bacardi Rum, Helena Rubenstein, Pepperidge Farm, Hathaway Shirt, Norelco and ABC Television. Jim served as the agency's chairman of the board for the next 10 years, also ascending to the presidency of the 4A's (American Association of Advertising Agencies). He retired in 1973 at the age of 50 to move with Geegee to a Castine, ME farm overlooking the Bagaduce River. Once in Castine, Jim quickly became involved in the community. He was an active member of Our Lady of Holy Hope Catholic Church and a founder of the volunteer Bagaduce Ambulance Corps, which continues to serve Castine and surrounding towns today. Jim also played a major role in Castine's ''revolt'' against a state uniform property tax, helping lead a successful statewide effort to repeal the unpopular tax. In 1976, he made an aggressive bid to represent Hancock County in the Main Senate. Opting to run as an independent, without party affiliation or support, Jim nevertheless garnered more than 4,000 votes in a four-way race that was won by the Republican incumbent. In 1980, he embarked on a career as a newspaper publisher, teaming with editor Hugh Bowden to launch the weekly Castine Patriot, serving the towns of Castine, Orland, Penobscot and Brooksville. Jim's strong and thoughtful viewpoints appeared each week in well-crafted editorials, each carefully written in longhand, that became the talk of the community. Though the newspaper has seen several owners since Jim sold it in 1982, it continues to flourish today. Jim had a keen mind and fiery temper and did not suffer fools gladly. But he was also sensitive, articulate and could be loyal almost to a fault. Partner David McCall said of him on his retirement, ''Jim has never hurt a fellow human being in his life. Jim not only treats everyone equally, he literally can't see any difference between the president of General Motors and the window washer-unless one of them is an ass.'' The McCaffrey's sold their Castine farm in 1997 and became residents of Parker Ridge, a retirement community in Blue Hill, ME. For more than 50 years, Jim was an avid fisherman in Maine, Canada and the Bahamas. His fishing partner and 55-year partner in life was always his wife. Regarding his stroke and ultimate death, Geegee commented to friends about their most recent trip to Canada: ''Jim caught a 10pound salmon before he had other things to do.'' And no one knows his no-holds-barred dedication to tomorrow better than she. In addition to his wife, Jim is survived by a daughter, Anne (''Nancy'') McCaffrey Rathmell of Belfast; and three granddaughters, Meghan Rathmell of Hollis, Erin Rathmell of West Tisbury, Mass., and Katharine Rathmell of Exeter, N.H. A funeral mass will be held Friday, July 27, at 10 A.M. at Our Lady of Holy Hope Catholic Church in Castine. Following interment in the Castine Cemetery, a celebration of Jim's life will be held in the dining room at Parker Ridge from noon to 4 P.M. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in his memory to the Post Polio Support Group of Maine, 674 HallowellLitchfield Rd, West Gardiner, ME 04345, or to Alzheimer's Disease Research, 15825 Shady Grove Rd, Suite 140, Rockville, MD 20850.",https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/25/classified/paid-notice-deaths-mccaffrey-james-j.html,,"McCAFFREY-James J., 79.

Though the newspaper has seen several owners since Jim sold it in 1982, it continues to flourish today. Jim had a keen mind and fiery temper and did not suffer fools gladly. But he was also sensitive, articulate and could be loyal almost to a fault. Partner David McCall said of him on his retirement, ''Jim has never hurt a fellow human being in his life. Jim not only treats everyone equally, he literally can't see any difference between the president of General Motors and the window washer-unless one of them is an ass.'' The McCaffrey's sold their Castine farm in 1997 and became residents of Parker Ridge, a retirement community in Blue Hill, ME. For more than 50 years, Jim was an avid fisherman in Maine, Canada and the Bahamas. His fishing partner and 55-year partner in life was always his wife. Regarding his stroke and ultimate death, Geegee commented to friends about their most recent trip to Canada: ''Jim caught a 10pound salmon before he had other things to do.'' And no one knows his no-holds-barred dedication to tomorrow better than she. In addition to his wife, Jim is survived by a daughter, Anne (''Nancy'') McCaffrey Rathmell of Belfast; and three granddaughters, Meghan Rathmell of Hollis, Erin Rathmell of West Tisbury, Mass., and Katharine Rathmell of Exeter, N.H. A funeral mass will be held Friday, July 27, at 10 A.M. at Our Lady of Holy Hope Catholic Church in Castine. Following interment in the Castine Cemetery, a celebration of Jim's life will be held in the dining room at Parker Ridge from noon to 4 P.M. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made in his memory to the Post Polio Support Group of Maine, 674 HallowellLitchfield Rd, West Gardiner, ME 04345, or to Alzheimer's Disease Research, 15825 Shady Grove Rd, Suite 140, Rockville, MD 20850.",A,15,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'persons', 'value': 'MCCAFFREY, JAMES J.', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}]",2001-07-25T05:00:00+0000,article,Classified,Archives,Paid Death Notice,nyt://article/21594a5d-e5f1-5d43-918c-e9f451a02bb0,831,nyt://article/21594a5d-e5f1-5d43-918c-e9f451a02bb0,"Paid Notice: Deaths  MCCAFFREY, JAMES J.",,,"Paid Notice: Deaths  MCCAFFREY, JAMES J.",,,,,[],,Alzheimer,

" WEST    ALASKA: A NORTH SLOPE SPILL -- Nearly 93,000 gallons of a mixture of salt water and crude oil have spilled from a pipe on the North Slope and saturated about an acre of tundra, officials said. The spill apparently occurred in a corroded section of pipe in the Kuparuk oil field and is believed to be one of the largest ever in the area, though most of the mixture is salt water. Environmentalists say the spill is one of many that occur in the area and cited the threat of similar accidents as a reason to block President Bush's proposal to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, about 100 miles to the east.
