"Continuing his effort to make New Jersey a leader in stem cell research, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey announced last Tuesday the creation of what he called the nation's first statewide public bank for umbilical and placental blood to be used by stem cell researchers and patients in need of transplants. Blood from the placenta and umbilical cord contains stem cells, and researchers hope such cells can eventually play a role in curing diabetes, AIDS, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, as well as in helping patients with strokes or spinal cord injuries. Stem cells can also take the place of bone marrow in transplants for people suffering from leukemia, lymphoma and sickle cell anemia. Use of these cells is less controversial than use of embryonic stem cells, which entail the destruction of an embryo.

Richard J. Codey announced last Tuesday the creation of what he called the nation's first statewide public bank for umbilical and placental blood to be used by stem cell researchers and patients in need of transplants. Blood from the placenta and umbilical cord contains stem cells, and researchers hope such cells can eventually play a role in curing diabetes, AIDS, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, as well as in helping patients with strokes or spinal cord injuries. Stem cells can also take the place of bone marrow in transplants for people suffering from leukemia, lymphoma and sickle cell anemia. Use of these cells is less controversial than use of embryonic stem cells, which entail the destruction of an embryo.

His signal contributions to the field were recognized by the American College of Radiology when it presented him with its highest honor, The Gold Medal, in 1977. His inspiring leadership at the medical school and its affiliated hospitals and his commitment to the highest standards for educating generations of caring and compassionate physicians have left an indelible legacy at our medical school.

" When Dr. Alan Schiller's 87-year-old mother died in January, ''it took some convincing,'' Schiller says, to get his siblings to agree to an autopsy. ''They said: 'She had Alzheimer's. Let her rest.' But I told them: 'No, something seems funny to me. An autopsy is the only way to be sure.''' Schiller prevailed. A tanned, quick-minded, gregarious man in his 60's, he is naturally persuasive, and as chairman of pathology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, he carries a certain authority regarding autopsies. The word ''autopsy,'' he reminded his siblings, means to ''see for oneself,'' and they should see what happened to their mother. Schiller's mother died in Miami, so he called his friend Dr. Robert Poppiti Jr., chairman of pathology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was on the table the next morning.     In a living patient, Alzheimer's is a diagnosis of exclusion, one that should ideally be reached only by eliminating all testable causes of fading memory and mind. Confirming it requires directly examining the brain. The definitive markers are the tiny protein plaques and fibrous tangles that appear under the microscope in stained sections. But a good pathologist can spot advanced Alzheimer's just by looking at the whole brain. The brain will be shorter, front to back, and more squarish than normal -- a reflection of Alzheimer's neuronal decimation, which shrinks the brain up to 15 percent. This would presumably have been the case with Mrs. Schiller. But the autopsist found her brain of normal shape and size. Dissecting it, he discovered a half-dozen cystlike lesions scattered throughout -- areas darker, softer and less elastic than the buff-colored parts surrounding them.

Calling hours Thursday 4 to 7 PM. Funeral service Friday, 11:30 A.M., at Frank E. Campbell, ''The Funeral Chapel'', 81 St and Madison Ave. In lieu of flowers donations to the Jacob Perlow Hospice.     YARMON--Morton. The entire Beth Israel Medical Center family joins with the leadership of its parent company, Continuum Health Partners, in acknowledging with sadness the passing of our dear and beloved friend, Morton Yarmon, who along with his wife, Continuum and Beth Israel Trustee Betty Yarmon, was a generous benefactor and staunch supporter of numerous hospital programs and services. A successful public relations executive, Mort firmly believed that people who have the means should reach out to institutions and organizations that can improve the quality of life for others in need. As the recipient of his extraordinary philanthropy, Continuum and Beth Israel named in his and Mrs. Yarmon's honor the Betty and Morton Yarmon Center for Parkinson's Disease; the Betty and Morton Yarmon Manhattan Hospice Residence; the Betty and Morton Yarmon Neurobehavior and Alzheimer's Disease Center; and the Betty and Morton Yarmon Stroke Center. In addition, the nurses' station at the Hyman-Newman Institute for Neurology and Neurosurgery, the Yarmon Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Gymnasium and the Yarmon Patient Lounge, all facilities at Beth Israel's former Singer Division, were also named in their honor. Mort's abiding humanitarianism was an inspiration to us all. To Betty and all the Yarmons' family and friends, we extend our heartfelt condolences. Morton P. Hyman, Chairman Boards of Trustees, Continuum and Beth Israel Stanley Brezenoff, President and CEO Continuum David J. Shulkin, M.D. President and CEO Beth Israel     YARMON -- Morton. The American Jewish Committee is profoundly saddened by the death of Morton Yarmon, a beloved staff member for nearly 30 years and an honorary member of our Board of Governors. Mort, a seasoned writer, editor, educator and quintessential public relations professional, joined AJC in 1963 as Director of the Department of Public Education and Information. His keen sense for news and his dedication to his craft helped AJC find a clarion voice in the media and deepened the public's understanding of the American Jewish agenda. His abiding respect for and appreciation of the media earned him a sterling reputation, and the esteem and affection of many reporters. Mort's devotion to the Jewish people and commitment to AJC's mission in Israel and around the world was reflected in his impeccable ethics and passion for his work. We were proud to honor him with AJC's Mass Media Award upon his retirement in 1991.

"FINNERAN--Gerard Buckley (''Jerry''). A longtime Greenwich resident, died December 29 at the Nathaniel Witherell Nursing Home in Greenwich, CT. He died of complications of Alzheimer's disease, according to his wife of 44 years, Judy Finneran of Stamford. Jerry was born February 16, 1937 in New York City to John Finneran and Dorothy Buckley Finneran, both of whom are deceased. He grew up in Larchmont, NY, and graduated from Iona Preparatory School in New Rochelle, NY in 1955. He then became part of the first graduating class from the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, CO, graduating in 1959. Subsequently, the Air Force sent him to the University of Michigan Graduate School of Business. After leaving the Air Force, Jerry took additional graduate courses at the N.Y.U. School of Business and completed the Advanced Management Program at the Harvard University School of Business. While in the Air Force, Jerry was stationed in Germany and Greece until his retirement in 1965 as a Captain. He joined Citibank's European Division in 1965 and was sent to London in 1966. He was then put in charge of opening and managing Citibank's subsidiary in Jersey, Channel Islands. In 1973, he returned to New York to set up and run Citibank's Latin American Investment Bank, which included investment banking offices in the major latin american countries. In 1983, he assumed responsibility for the North American Investment Bank for Citibank. He was a Senior Vice President and Senior Credit Officer at Citibank, and had worldwide investment banking responsibilities for the syndicated loan product. In 1985, he joined Drexel Burnham as a Managing Director to establish a Latin American Investment Banking Division for Drexel. He created a fund with one hundred seventy two million dollars to invest in Latin American debt and equities and became President of the Fund, DBL, America's Development Associations LP. In 1990, Trust Company of the West acquired the fund, changing the name to TCW America's Development Association, LP. In 1991, the charter of the fund was changed to encompass emerging markets debt and equity worldwide, and he also assumed responsibility for the co-management of the Argentine Investment Company, a private equity fund. In recent years, he volunteered with the South Forty Corporation, a non-profit organization that assists newly-released convicts in finding employment and reestablishing their lives. Jerry was involved in sports all of his life, lettering in football, baseball, basketball and diving in high school, and received sports scholarships to over 15 colleges. He was also the first person to receive the Con Edison Sportsman of the Week Award in two sports, football and diving. At the Air Force Academy, he was a quarterback for the football team and a member of the diving and baseball teams. As a member of the Millbrook Club for over 31 years, he enjoyed golf, tennis and paddle tennis. Besides his wife, Jerry is survived by his daughter, Laurie Calder of Bethesda, MD, his son, Mark Finneran of Fairfield, CT, two sisters, Judith Finneran of Greenwich, CT and Susan Ashley of Westport, CT, a brother, William Finneran of New York City, and three grandchildren. He was predeceased by his son, Scott Finneran, and his brother, John Finneran. A memorial service will be held at St. Mary's Church in Greenwich, CT, on Tuesday, January 4, 2005 at 10 AM. There are no calling hours. Burial will be private. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research, 1 Intrepid Square, West 46 St and 12 Ave, NY, NY 10036, or by contacting www.alzinfo.org    FINNERAN--Gerard B. Jerry was one of the founding partners of TCW Worldwide and the author of its eclectic but very successful investment style. He was a consummate value investor who could see around corners. And he was a wonderful boss who focused on what people could do, not on what they couldn't. He engendered loyalty and love from those who were lucky enough to have the opportunity to work with him. His enthusiasm, caring and absolute fearlessness will be sorely missed.

"A THEATRICAL two-hander, especially one as delicate as ''The Gin Game,'' is all about being in sync. William Schallert and C.C. Loveheart, the actors in the current version of the Pulitzer -winning play at the Bickford Theater here, had yet to achieve a fluent partnership on opening night; rather than feeding off each other, they seemed afraid of getting in each other's way. Their performances have no doubt grown smoother in the days since, but that initial rockiness underscored that the play itself, like its two characters, is showing the effects of age.     It has been almost 30 years since the play, by D.L. Coburn, won the Pulitzer Prize, buoyed by a legendary rendition on Broadway starring Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy. Even back then, plays about old age were something of a genre. Now, with baby boomer writers seeing their own parents reach the frail years, actors past a certain age are almost required to have an Alzheimer's sufferer, a cancer patient, a stroke victim in their kit bags, and issues like elder abuse and neglect are all over the stage and the Lifetime network.

Beloved husband for 57 years of Anne Gibson Clark Washburn, and loving father of Constance Clark Washburn of Lagunitas, CA, and Lynn Washburn Hanke of New York. He leaves five grandchildren: Andrew and William Castle and Leigh, Randall and David Hanke. Mr. Washburn was born in Reading, PA in 1914. During the Depression, he worked his way through New York University (Class of 1936). During World War II, he served in the U.S. Navy from 1941 to 1945 on patrol in the North Atlantic with experimental subchasers and later in command of the Destroyer Escort USS Vammen, which saw combat in the Okinawa invasion. Managing men, arms and supplies prepared him for the responsible leadership he would later demonstrate during a forty-plusyear career as a pioneer of the mutual fund industry. He managed the first mutual fund department on Wall Street at Kidder Peabody from 1949 to 1953. By 1961 he formed the Sales Training Institute to prepare a fast-growing sales force, and served as the first President of the National Mutual Fund Managers Association in 1967. He was a partner at Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis from 1963 to 1971, and later with Loeb Rhodes & Co. and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette he continued to advance the development and marketing of mutual funds. From postwar years in Forest Hills where he joined the West Side Tennis Club to The Maidstone Club in East Hampton and The Bath & Tennis in Palm Beach, Mr. Washburn was a fixture on the tennis court and the dance floor. A lifetime of skiing, skating, sailing, golf and ocean swimming made him a tireless ballroom dancing partner. He also had a passion for sailboat racing where he often served as both cook and navigator on Bermuda races.

Beloved husband for 57 years of Anne Gibson Clark Washburn, and loving father of Constance Clark Washburn of Lagunitas, CA, and Lynn Washburn Hanke of New York. He leaves five grandchildren: Andrew and William Castle and Leigh, Randall and David Hanke. Mr. Washburn was born in Reading, PA in 1914. During the Depression, he worked his way through New York University (Class of 1936). During World War II, he served in the U.S. Navy from 1941 to 1945 on patrol in the North Atlantic with experimental subchasers and later in command of the Destroyer Escort USS Vammen, which saw combat in the Okinawa invasion. Managing men, arms and supplies prepared him for the responsible leadership he would later demonstrate during a forty-plusyear career as a pioneer of the mutual fund industry. He managed the first mutual fund department on Wall Street at Kidder Peabody from 1949 to 1953. By 1961 he formed the Sales Training Institute to prepare a fast-growing sales force, and served as the first President of the National Mutual Fund Managers Association in 1967. He was a partner at Paine Webber Jackson & Curtis from 1963 to 1971, and later with Loeb Rhodes & Co. and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette he continued to advance the development and marketing of mutual funds. From postwar years in Forest Hills where he joined the West Side Tennis Club to The Maidstone Club in East Hampton and The Bath & Tennis in Palm Beach, Mr. Washburn was a fixture on the tennis court and the dance floor. A lifetime of skiing, skating, sailing, golf and ocean swimming made him a tireless ballroom dancing partner. He also had a passion for sailboat racing where he often served as both cook and navigator on Bermuda races. A gracious gentleman who could never be found without his warm smile and engaging sense of humor, George Washburn will be missed by all who knew him.

" A Barnstorming Exhibition      After a tour around the country, ''Barn Again! Celebrating an American Icon'' made its first stop in Connecticut last week , opening at the Lebanon Historical Society Museum. The show, part of the Smithsonian Institution's traveling exhibitions program, looks at the evolution of the barn. The Lebanon Historical Society also has a number of exhibitions and programs about the area's agricultural heritage and there is a program for children. The museum is open Wednesday through Sunday, noon to 4 p.m. Information: (860)642-6579. The exhibition runs through May 22.    A Premiere at Yale      August Wilson will premiere his play, ''Radio Golf'' on Friday at the Yale Repertory Theater at 1120 Chapel Street, at York Street.     ''Radio Golf,'' set in the 1990's, revolves around a man claiming ownership of a district in Pittsburgh that is to be declared blighted and scheduled for demolition by the government to make way for a redevelopment project.     The plot involves a scheme for diverting federal money for redevelopment into buying a radio station, a plan to teach inner-city kids to play golf as a means of shoehorning them into the middle class, and a bid to become the city's first black mayor.    The play runs through May 14. Performances are scheduled Monday through Saturday at 8 p.m., with Saturday matinees beginning April 30 at 2 p.m., and one Wednesday matinee on May 11. Tickets are $20 to $45. Information: (203)432-1234.    Comedy Package      Jack Klugman, who played Oscar Madison, a sportswriter and the sloppy half of ''The Odd Couple'' in the television series that co-starred Tony Randall, will appear with Brett Somers, who played Oscar's wife on the show, at the Quick Center for the Arts at Fairfield University.    They will appear in three performances of ''Danger, People at Large,'' a collection of three short comedies by Fred Stroppel.    ''After the Ball'' is about a banker returning home from a funeral; ''Louie's Daughter'' eavesdrops on two old-timers in a bar; and in ''Glacier Bay'' an elderly woman copes with her husband, who has Alzheimer's disease.     Tickets for performances Thursday through Saturday at 8 p.m. are $25. The box office number is (203)254-4010.    Quindlen at Wesleyan      Anna Quindlen, a Newsweek columnist and a former New York Times columnist, will speak at Wesleyan University, where she is the visiting writer for 2005.    The program will take place Wednesday at 8 p.m. in the university's Memorial Chapel at 221 High Street in Middletown. Admission is free. Information: (860)685-2280.    Albright to Speak      Madeleine K. Albright will talk on Wednesday about her journey from a young refugee to Secretary of State in the Clinton administration.     Ms. Albright will review her work from 1997 to 2001 in expanding NATO, dealing with massacres in Kosovo, and halting the proliferation of nuclear weapons in Russia during the Clinton presidency.    She will also address contemporary issues, including the war on terrorism and the search for peace in the Middle East.     The lecture will take place in the Lyman Center for the Performing Arts at Southern Connecticut State University, 501 Crescent Street, in New Haven at 7 p.m.    Tickets are $15, or $10 for those 65 or older.

" Europe Lifting Sanctions On Many U.S. Products  The European Union is lifting sanctions on American products now that Congress has repealed tax cuts for exporters that were declared illegal by the World Trade Organization.    The Europeans couched the announcement as another gesture of good will in their trade relationship with the United States. Earlier this month, the two trading giants backed away from suing each other over subsidies they each give to their biggest civilian aircraft makers. [Page C3.]    G.E. Reports Strong Profit Growth  General Electric, citing robust growth in almost all of its major business units, reported record fourth-quarter earnings of $5.4 billion. Jeffrey R. Immelt, left, the chief executive, said last month that he thought G.E. would deliver earnings growth of as much as 17 percent this year. Analysts said the quarterly report represented a solid start toward delivering on that promise. [C2.]    Powell to Step Down From F.C.C.  Michael K. Powell, the head of the Federal Communications Commission, said he would be stepping down in two months. On his watch the F.C.C. was noted for its tough enforcement of decency standards. He has told friends that he will take time off to consider his next career move. [A1.]    Union at US Airways Approves Cuts  Members of the machinists' union at US Airways voted in favor of $269 million in wage and benefit cuts, completing the airline's efforts to win concessions from its employees. [C4.]    America West Airlines' parent company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $49.7 million, citing high fuel costs and low fares. [C4.]    Euro Disney Plans to Sell Stock  Euro Disney, seeking to complete a refinancing of its troubled theme parks, will raise 253 million euros, or $328 million, by selling shares at 0.09 euro each. The extraordinarily low price hurt the value of existing shares. [C3.]    Rules for Drug Benefit Disclosed  The Bush administration unveiled rules for the new Medicare drug benefit that guarantee patients access to a wide range of medicines while giving insurance companies tools to control costs. The rules say a prescription drug plan can establish a list of preferred drugs and refuse to pay for other medicines. [A11.]    Stock Market Drops for Third Week  A surge in oil prices sent the major stock indexes to their lowest levels of the year. All three indexes fell for the third consecutive week. The Dow and S.&P. 500 have not started January with three down weeks since 1977. For the week, the Dow fell 1.6 percent, the S.&P. was down 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq composite dropped 2.6 percent. [C4.]    Safety of J.&J. Drug Reviewed  Health regulators are reviewing the safety of Reminyl, a Johnson & Johnson drug for Alzheimer's disease, after two clinical trials in which people taking the drug had a much higher death rate than those taking a placebo. [C4.]    Asia Helps United Technologies  United Technologies said its quarterly profit rose 10.5 percent as the construction boom in Asia helped its Otis and Carrier units. [C2.]    Citigroup Says S.E.C. May Act  Regulators may recommend a civil injunction or administrative proceedings against two Citigroup units and four people. Citigroup said the actions were related to an internal transfer agent unit that served more than 20 Citigroup-managed closed-end funds.

A1    Economists say that because there is no damage even as little as a mile away from the battered shores in affected countries, there is a perverse likelihood that one of the world's largest-ever human disasters may have a relatively marginal economic impact.   A1    So much aid is now piling up in warehouses and on tarmacs around the Indian Ocean that officials are trying to avert a second potential disaster that often strikes in the aftermath of human tragedies: a lack of coordination among those seeking to help.   A9    Rebel Campaign on Iraqi Forces  Insurgents killed 18 members of the Iraqi national guard and a civilian with a suicide car bomb north of Baghdad. Meanwhile, several police officers and local officials were killed in other attacks around the country.   A1    Abbas Makes Plea to Militants  Mahmoud Abbas, the favorite in the impending Palestinian presidential election, visited the northern Gaza Strip and called on militants to stop firing rockets at Israel. His remarks came just hours after the latest salvos prompted a brief Israeli incursion in the area.   A3    Spanish Leader Faces Crisis  The Basque region's declaration that it has the right to secede from Spain has pushed Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero toward the first crisis of his tenure. Editorial writers and politicians say his affinity for following the polls has kept him from taking on tough issues.   A6    NATIONAL   A11-13    Vigorous Interrogation Expected For Nominee  The Senate Judiciary Committee begins hearings on Thursday to consider President Bush's nomination of Albert R. Gonzales to be attorney general. Mr. Gonzales may face a vigorous interrogation because of his role in overseeing internal legal memorandums that appeared to condone mistreatment of detainees.   A13    Hastert Asserts His Power  J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, has emerged as a powerful force, the man President Bush is counting on to enact his ambitious second-term agenda, including Social Security legislation and changes in the tax code.   A1    New Head for Paramount  A deal that would name the veteran talent manager Brad Grey to head Paramount Pictures is almost finished, people involved in it said. He would replace Sherry Lansing, who announced late last year that she would retire after her contract expired in September 2005.   A11    Bush Celebrates Inauguration  Kelsey Grammer will be the M.C. at a kickoff inaugural gala honoring the military, the rap artist Kid Rock will perform at an inaugural youth concert and President Bush's most reliable fund-raisers have so far collected $15 million for three days of meticulously planned parties to celebrate his second swearing-in.   A13    Former Judge Focus of Case  A retired federal judge who ruled in 1982 that mental hospitals were violating the rights of patients now has dementia and is at the center of a dispute over whether he should be released from his nursing home. As the nation's population ages and the number of Alzheimer's patients rises, the case could have important ramifications.   A11    NEW YORK/REGION   B1-5    White Plains Savors New High-Rise Lifestyle  The construction of 35-story residential towers in White Plains is giving the city something that no other city in Westchester has: a skyline. The project continues the development boom that began two years ago.   B1    Readying for Battle  New York's heavily Democratic delegation on Capitol Hill will battle with conservative lawmakers over federal funds when Congress convenes this month, and New York Republicans may step in to help force concessions.   B1    Pastor Endorses Bloomberg  Mayor Bloomberg accepted the endorsement of the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, the influential pastor of Allen A.M.E. Church in Queens, a significant step toward connecting with non-white voters.

How well it does that may have a profound effect on prospects for continued world growth.   C1    The market performed relatively well in 2004, buoyed by corporate profits that were stronger than expected and interest rates that were lower than feared, Wall Street analysts say.

"Hank (Don't Call Me Henry) Greely, professor of law and of genetics at Stanford University, created a stir in the scientific world, not to mention in the zoological fraternity, when he told Sharon Begley of The Wall Street Journal, ''The centaur has left the barn.''    A centaur is the mythical beast dreamed up by the Greeks with the head and arms and torso of a man and the body and legs of a horse.

By Tab Hunter with Eddie Muller. (Algonquin, $24.95.) The interesting thing about Hunter has never been his soporific movies, like ""Island of Desire"" or ""Lust in the Dust,"" or even his treacly 1957 hit single, ""Young Love."" It's himself. In his memoir, Hunter provides a mesmerizing account of his Candide-like journey through Hollywood. Never a gifted actor, Hunter, who grew up in Southern California, rode his all-American looks to a seven-year studio contract with Warner Brothers, which signed him up at age 23 and transformed him almost overnight into a teeny-bopper idol. The twist, of course, was that Hunter, like any number of Hollywood leading men, was gay. He soon chafed under a rigid studio system that seemed designed to wring any lingering vestiges of spontaneity out of filmmakers and actors, though it had some advantages. It offered not only a steady salary, but protection from scurrilous rags like Confidential magazine, which sought to out the stars of the day.

"This past spring, in a secluded patch of forest in northwest Louisiana's Caddo Parish, a singularly bizarre bit of evolution unfolded.

Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Broadway    +'BROOKLYN BOY' One of the mortifications of middle age is being forced to admit the truth in those extra-mossy clichés that you mock when you are young and arrogant. The past always catches up with you; blood is thicker than water; be careful what you wish for. These are among the stale-but-true bromides that are acknowledged by the title character in Donald Margulies's sincere but doggedly unsurprising new play about the midlife crisis of a suddenly successful novelist (Adam Arkin). While this comic drama is steeped in an admirably humble and often touching spirit of acceptance, it seldom does what Mr. Margulies has achieved repeatedly before: make the familiar seem fresh. Polly Draper and Ari Graynor stand out in an excellent cast, smoothly directed by Daniel Sullivan (2:20). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $26 to $79.  BEN BRANTLEY    +'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' From the moment it sounds its first word in David Leveaux's placid revival, the voice of Harvey Fierstein (who has replaced Alfred Molina in the central role of Tevye) makes the audience prick up its ears. Heard not so long ago issuing from the plus-size form of Edna Turnblad in the musical ''Hairspray,'' Mr. Fierstein's voice is one of the most distinctive in theater, variously evoking a kazoo, a congested saxophone, wind in a bottle and echoes from a crypt. It is, in a way, its own multicolored show. Whether it fits comfortably into the little Russian village of Anatevka is another issue. But at least it brings a bit of zest to Mr. Leveaux's abidingly bland production (2:55). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $100.  BRANTLEY    +'GOOD VIBRATIONS' Even those who believe that everything on this planet has a purpose may at first have trouble justifying the existence of ''Good Vibrations,'' the singing headache that manages to purge all catchiness from the surpassingly catchy hits of the Beach Boys. But audience members strong enough to sit through this rickety jukebox of a show will discover that the production, directed and choreographed by John Carrafa, does have a reason to be. ''Good Vibrations'' sacrifices itself to make all other musicals on Broadway look good. As the show's washboard-stomached performers smile, wriggle and squeak with the desperation of wet young things hung out to dry, you feel their pain. It is unlikely, however, to be more acute than yours (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $76 to $101; a limited number of $25 student rush tickets are available at the box office on the day of the show.  BRANTLEY    +'LITTLE WOMEN' Sutton Foster never merely walks when she can scamper in this perky, sketchy adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel of a Civil War-era New England girlhood. Portraying Jo the tomboy, Ms. Foster creates a dizzyingly hyperkinetic creature who, were she living in the 21st century, would probably be on Ritalin. Ms. Foster (a Tony winner for ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'') shows a gift for fresh, comic line readings. But her energy is often less infectious than exhausting. The same can be said of the show, directed by Susan H. Schulman and featuring a book by Allan Knee, with songs by Jason Howland and Mindi Dickstein. Watching the production is rather like speed-reading Alcott's novel. And the cast members, who include the mellow-voiced Maureen McGovern, mostly bring to mind 1860's-themed editions of the American Girl series of dolls (2:20). Virginia Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $100.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    +'BELFAST BLUES' The ''Belfast Blues'' of Geraldine Hughes's solo show aren't the kind you'd expect. Yes, the ''troubles'' between Roman Catholics and Protestants that have roiled Northern Ireland for decades do cast an emotional shadow over this heartfelt and funny if unexceptional stage memoir, descriptively subtitled ''one wee girl's story about family, war, Jesus and Hollywood.'' But Ms. Hughes's title more directly refers to her big, inquisitive and exceptionally expressive eyes, which helped secure that wee girl a ticket to a happier life. ''Belfast Blues,'' which recounts her experience growing up amid poverty and violence in Belfast in the 1970's and 80's, does not bring any groundbreaking insights to familiar territory. But Ms. Hughes is a bright, inviting presence, and the surprising agent of her deliverance from the troubled atmosphere of her youth gives the show a modestly refreshing twist (1:25). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, (212)307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 4 p.m. Tickets: $45; a limited number of $20 student rush tickets are available at the box office one hour before the performance.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    'THE CHERRY ORCHARD' In this stunningly powerful production, an intriguing balance arises between Lopakhin, the bourgeois former serf, and the aristocratic family that owns the cherry orchard and whose fortunes are all but dried up. The landowner Lyubov Ranevskaya (Petronia Paley), returning penniless from her life abroad, is as elegant as she is self-delusional. Against her beauty and her dignity, Lopakhin (Wendell Pierce), the archetype of the small-minded arriviste, is a hard man to like. But this production brings out their shared past in subtle but forceful gestures that complicate the audience's sympathies (2:00). Harlem School of the Arts Theater, 645 St. Nicholas Avenue, near 141st Street, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25.  CAMPBELL ROBERTSON    'COUNSELLOR-AT-LAW' Entertainment in abundance radiates from the Peccadillo Theater Company's new production of the old Elmer Rice drama ''Counsellor-at-Law.'' Starring the Tony Award-winning John Rubinstein, ''Counsellor-at-Law'' is a drama that throbs with New York life and brims with touchstones of another time, like ''George White's Scandals'' and the Court of General Sessions. But it also retains relevance to ambition and success in the 21st century. It has a hero worth rooting for, a healthy dose of sacred and profane love, some sharp jabs at class difference, villains who merit a hearty hiss and plenty of New York attitude and humor (2:45). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)868-4444. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $55; $20 student rush tickets available at the box office 15 minutes before the performance.  LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    +'SABINA' Once a forgotten ghost in the annals of psychoanalysis, Sabina Spielrein is proving to have surprising staying power. A patient of Carl Jung and an acquaintance of Sigmund Freud who ultimately became a psychoanalyst herself, Spielrein has a history that has provided material for two movies and two plays. The first of these was Willy Holtzman's ''Sabina,'' first produced by Primary Stages in 1996 and now in revival as part of the company's 20th-anniversary season. The new production, directed by Ethan McSweeny, is hampered by an unsatisfactory performance from Marin Ireland in the title role. But the history of Spielrein's relationships with the founder of psychoanalysis and his protégé turned apostate is nonetheless engrossing. It provides a provocative window into the much-studied relationship between Freud and Jung. Peter Strauss gives an admirably understated performance as a paternalistic Freud, and Victor Slezak, as Jung, gives persuasive dramatic life to a now-mythic figure. (2:15). Primary Stages, at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212)279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays though Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.  ISHERWOOD    'SHYLOCK' Deconstructing Shakespeare is a dangerous sport; it's impossible to be more imaginative or clever than the playwright himself, even if you are Harold Bloom. Gareth Armstrong gives it a game try, but ''Shylock,'' his 80-minute dissertation on the evolution of one of Shakespeare's most memorable characters, although deftly performed, is no exception. While his pocket synopses of anti-Semitism, Elizabethan England, Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta'' and even a Baedeker of famous actors' renditions of Shylock are edifying, they are not sufficiently enlightening or entertaining. The most riveting lines of Mr. Armstrong's monologue belong to Shakespeare himself (1:35). Perry Street Theater, 31 Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $55; a limited number of $20 student/senior rush tickets available at the box office 30 minutes before the performance.  PHOEBE HOBAN    +'SLEEPING BEAUTY' Trust a British ''Sleeping Beauty'' to pivot on a fairy's flatulence. Yes, that surefire laugh trigger in old Blighty plays an unexpectedly large role in Rufus Norris's murky new version of the familiar fairy tale for the Young Vic Theater Company. Mr. Norris, a talented young British director whose Broadway-bound production of ''Festen'' snapped up many London theater awards, isn't interested in pretty pictures. His vigorously staged, grotesquely comic ''Sleeping Beauty,'' which unfolds in smoky darkness beneath a queasy yellow moon, is entirely in tune with the current vogue for teasing out thickets of disturbing subtext in children's literature. The production's eccentric designs accentuate the predominantly eerie air (2:00). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 7; tomorrow and Sunday at 1 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $10, $20 and $30.  ISHERWOOD    +'TEXAS HOMOS' Often in theater, the provocativeness of a play's title correlates with quality, and not in a good way. But ''Texas Homos'' is a pleasant exception. The title's tone does serve a purpose: it signals that the language in this show is far filthier than some theatergoers might care for, but the play is artfully constructed and convincingly acted, especially by Reed Birney and Richard Bekins in the central roles. Cecil (Mr. Birney) and Jim Bob (Mr. Bekins) have been caught engaging in gay sex in a police sting at a public restroom in Tyler, Tex. Since one is the town doctor and the other a preacher, and since both have wives and children, this creates more than a few problems. ''Texas Homos'' is not really about gay men at all. It is about everyone who has a secret life, and the nightmare that envelops such people once they are discovered. Mr. Birney's portrait of desperation and defiance feels dead on, and so does Mr. Bekins's of resignation and surrender (2:00). June Havoc Theater, Abingdon Theater Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212)868-4444. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 3. Tickets: $25.  NEIL GENZLINGER    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as standup existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. This monologue, which runs just over an hour and requires minimal stagecraft, is as unassuming in its means as it is astonishing in its impact. It's one of those treasured nights in the theater -- treasured nights anywhere, for that matter -- that can leave you both breathless with exhilaration and, depending on your sensitivity to meditations on the bleak and beautiful mysteries of human experience, in a puddle of tears. Also in stitches, here and there. Mr. Eno and his performer, the actor James Urbaniak, hereby reinvent that seemingly moribund theatrical genre, the solo show. They are immeasurably aided by the work of the director Hal Brooks. Mr. Eno's voice, or the voice of the narrator/protagonist/master of ceremonies played by Mr. Urbaniak, is alternately lyrical and affectless, ecstatic and flat, sardonic and sincere. Standup-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative: Mr. Eno might be called a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation. Let's try that again, minus the conditional: Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 6 and 9 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets; $45.  ISHERWOOD    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' This lovably inconsequential, entirely adorable new musical brings to the stage the culture's current mania for celebrating that most revered of American virtues, the will to victory. A mock spelling bee, it pokes serious fun at its twitchy tween contestants -- in the loopy spirit of the movies ''Waiting for Guffman'' and ''Best in Show'' -- but also pays affectionate tribute to these quirky young spelling titans. William Finn's nimble, upbeat score provides the emotional underpinning for Rachel Sheinkin's more satirical -- indeed often riotously funny -- book. The director James Lapine, Mr. Finn's collaborator on ''Falsettos,'' is also in impeccable form, managing to transform into virtues two of the theater's most reliable pitfalls, namely audience participation and the usually ghastly conceit of adult actors' playing kids (1:45). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212)246-4422. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $75.  ISHERWOOD    'WASTED (THE MYSTERY/HISTORY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND HOW IT GOT THAT WAY)' In ''Wasted,'' the Irondale Ensemble Project tries to answer a very difficult question: How do you make a play about the history of the public school system in American without being terribly boring? While they came up with a number of solutions, none were satisfactory. History is reduced to good guys and bad guys, who both talk in slogans: should school teach kids to think for themselves or prepare them for the workforce? The decline of the school system is told simply as a story of dark conspiracies motivated by corporate greed. In the end, you get the sense that this show is made by people who have spent little time reflecting on the ideas of the other side (2:00). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212)352-3101. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $25; $15 for seniors, students and New York City Public School teachers; on Thursdays pay what you can afford.  JASON ZINOMAN    Off Off Broadway    'THE CONFESSIONS OF PUNCH AND JUDY' The anarchist Punch and his wife, Judy, have been beating each other senseless for centuries, but while the famously warring married couple is usually performed by puppets, two real-life actors do the quarreling in ''The Confessions of Punch and Judy,'' a rigorously performed modern update with a surplus of energy and a deficit of direction. Ker Wells and Tannis Kowalchuk, who wrote the drama with the director Raymond Bobgan, play the pair in this pedestrian production, which mixes mime, ballroom dance, first-person monologues, puppetry and naturalistic acting. The play has few original thematic or design ideas and never reinvents the stock characters in an interesting way. In the end, it has no insight that you won't learn later this year in the revival of Edward Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' (1:10). Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212)868-4444. Wednesdays through Sundays at 7 p.m. Tickets: $15.  ZINOMAN    'DAY OF RECKONING' This play about the anarchist and labor reformer Lucy Parsons is unevenly paced and clumsily staged, but it has this saving grace: unlike some other theatrical efforts associated with Black History Month, it is not shallow hero worship. Parsons was a decidedly flawed hero, and Melody Cooper, the playwright, leaves those flaws in plain sight. As a young woman, Parsons, played by Ms. Cooper, called herself Lucy Gonzalez and tried to pass as Mexican and American Indian, chafing at any suggestion that she was black. And in her militant-labor phase, with her white husband, Albert, she exhorted followers, ''Learn to use explosives.'' When the Parsonses' domestic bliss is shattered by the Haymarket Riot of 1886, Lucy loses her bearings, and her son pays an appalling price. Ms. Cooper's recounting of this fascinating life could benefit from a large infusion of understatement, but still, Parsons's story is one that deserves to be told, especially at a time when those with radical ideas are again under intense scrutiny (1:50). All Stars Project's Performing Arts and Education Center, 543 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)941-1234. Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $15.  GENZLINGER    'THE FLID SHOW' With the drug Vioxx making headlines because of its recent recall over adverse side effects, Richard Willett's play ''The Flid Show'' gains an unsettling topicality. The play traces the history of Thalidomide, the sleeping pill widely distributed in Europe in the late 1950's and early 60's that caused birth defects when taken by pregnant women. Mat Fraser, a seasoned and charismatic British actor who was himself a ''Thalidomide baby,'' stars as Duncan, a lounge singer coming to grips with the anger and resentment fueled by his lifelong struggles. In Mr. Willett's fanciful dramatic scheme -- borrowed from a certain Dickens holiday favorite, as he acknowledges -- Duncan's psychological scars are healed by a series of ghostly visitors who sweep him through time and space. The documentary aspects of the play are absorbing and often poignant (particularly Amy Staats' monologue as a bereaved Belgian mother), but Duncan's personal story, centering on his rocky romance with a doctor and a reconciliation, in spirit at least, with his dead mother, is crudely drawn and clichéd. The director Eliza Beckwith's production is also on the clunky side, with most of the acting not up to the standard set by Mr. Fraser in the central role (2:15). Medicine Show Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212)352-3101. Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $15; $30 for a special benefit performance on Feb. 24.  ISHERWOOD    Last Chance    +'THE HOUSE OF BERNARDA ALBA' The role of Bernarda Alba has not changed in this production: she is still the tyrannical widowed mother of five daughters who are burning to free themselves from her stifling house. But here it's Poncia (Joanne Camp), the maid, who sets the tone. Poncia's world-weariness instills the play with an earthy, prosaic feel rather than a poetic one. Gone is the passion, and gone, too, is the terror when the tragic consequences of Bernarda's tyranny are revealed. Gone, in other words, is the heat that permeates the play. In its place is a comfy warmth, a fireside instead of an inferno (1:45). Pearl Theater Company, at Theater 80, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212)598-9802. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50 for tomorrow evening and Sunday; matinee tomorrow, $40.  ROBERTSON    *'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege, in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Arliss Howard and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination (1:05). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212)239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.  BRANTLEY    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    'ALIENS OF THE DEEP' Directed by James Cameron and Steven Quale. (G, 48 minutes). When the director James Cameron proclaimed himself ''king of the world'' on winning the Oscar for ''Titanic,'' who knew that he also had designs on the rest of the solar system? His newest film, ''Aliens of the Deep,'' is a grandiose hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy that begins on our planet's ocean floor and ends many miles under the ice crust that covers Europa, the second moon of Jupiter. The movie's sneaky transition from undersea documentary to speculative fantasy of a journey yet to be undertaken is so seamless that you could easily mistake the last portion of the film for the record of an actual space voyage. Mr. Cameron's theory, supported by astrobiologists, is that the life forms found at the deepest levels of the ocean where no light from the sun penetrates may hold clues to the nature of possible life in outer space. Filmed in Imax 3-D, it is a visual adventure worthy of that much-degraded adjective, awesome.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    'ASSISTED LIVING' Starring Michael Bonsignore and Maggie Riley. Directed by Elliot Greenebaum. (No rating, 77 minutes). As nursing homes go, Meadow View, the site of this hard-headed comedy that feels like a documentary, is a far cry from the hellholes we sometimes read about, where the elderly are dumped and treated like prisoners. The rooms are clean and the staff efficient. Life there is viewed through the institution's scruffy 27-year-old janitor (Mr. Bonsignore) who regularly sneaks off to smoke pot, is careless about punctuality, and plays affectionate pranks on the residents to relieve his boredom. The wisp of a plot follows Todd's relationship with a patient (Ms. Riley) suffering from early Alzheimer's disease. ''Assisted Living'' may be a comedy, but its images of physical frailty are inescapably unsettling.  HOLDEN    'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone -- two times when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie, where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At the age of 18, he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, that preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'BOOGEYMAN' Starring Barry Watson. Directed by Stephen Kay (PG-13, 86 minutes). There are a lot of close-ups of doorknobs and water faucets in Mr. Kay's would-be horror film. There is a supernaturally speedy killing accomplished with heavy-duty plastic wrap. There is frequent whooshing and rapid camera movement. Despite all of that, it isn't scary. Mr. Watson, of ''Seventh Heaven,'' plays Tim, a grown man who has been afraid of the boogeyman ever since he was 8, when something creepy sucked his father into a closet and out of this life. After his mother's death, Tim vows to spend a night in his childhood home to allay his fears, but, sure enough, the boogeyman is back and after him and everyone he cares about (well, an uncle and two girlfriends). The house is very creaky; so is the movie.  ANITA GATES    'COACH CARTER' Starring Samuel L. Jackson, Rob Brown, Robert Ri'chard, Rick Gonzalez, Nana Gbewonyo and Antwon Tanner. Directed by Thomas Carter (PG-13, 137 minutes). In this solid, unsurprising inspirational-coach drama, Mr. Jackson plays Ken Carter, who returns to his old high school in the tough Northern California city of Richmond to turn a squad of underachieving misfits into winners, both on and off the court. Based on a true story, the movie combines sports-picture suspense with heroic-educator uplift when Carter, dismayed that his players are slipping academically, padlocks the gym in the midst of an undefeated season. Mr. Carter (the director, not related to the coach) infuses this sentimental warhorse with some flourishes of realism, which are bolstered by the hip-hop soundtrack and by the performances of the younger cast members, especially Mr. Brown as a talented forward struggling with his responsibilities, Ashanti as his girlfriend, and Mr. Gonzalez as a player sliding toward a life of crime.  A.O. SCOTT    *'HEAD-ON' Starring Birol Unel, Sibel Kekilli, Catrin Striebeck and Guven Kirac. Directed by Fatih Akin (Not rated, 118 minutes). In German and Turkish, with English subtitles. Love doesn't just hurt in the jagged German romance ''Head-On''; it cuts and bleeds and even kills. A story about a lonely man and a still-lonelier woman fighting against their worlds and what often seems like their own best interests, the film has caused a stir in Germany for the murky, troubling light it sheds on the lives of the country's Turkish immigrants. Its popularity made it a fleeting social phenomenon and a minor cultural footnote. But it doesn't explain why this film about two strangers with suicidal tendencies and a deep commitment to self-aggrandizing drama is the first very good movie of this very young year. One of the truisms about romances, even those shaded pitch black and set to banging rock music, is that you have to fall in love with the characters when they're falling for each other. It takes a long time for Cahit (Mr. Unel) and Sibel (Ms. Kekilli) to get inside each other's heads, much less anywhere else, but it doesn't take us long to care about these two perfectly imperfect beings.  DARGIS    'HIDE AND SEEK' Starring Robert De Niro, Dakota Fanning, Famke Janssen, Elisabeth Shue, Amy Irving, Dylan Baker and Melissa Leo. Directed by John Polson. (R, 105 minutes). In the downbeat, sufficiently unsettling ''Hide and Seek,'' Mr. De Niro plays a New York City shrink, David, who's married to a somnolent type (Ms. Irving), whose love for their daughter, Emily (Ms. Fanning), can't disguise her unhappiness. Soon after the story starts, violence descends on the family, and David and Emily move to the country for some healing. Once there, things go from lousy to worse, as Emily starts staring blankly into the surrounding woods and palling around with a sinister invisible friend called Charlie. Blood drips into the story; then it pours. One of the most gifted child actors around, Ms. Fanning has both chops and a preternaturally intense screen presence; even when you don't believe the setup, you buy what she is selling. That's a good thing when it comes to this horror-thriller hybrid, which was written by Ari Schlossberg and needs all the help it can get from its actors.  DARGIS    *'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller, based on fact, performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage that it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered into the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed in ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a hundred-day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.  HOLDEN    'IN GOOD COMPANY' Starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (PG-13, 106 minutes). This gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture, a site of our leading blood sport. Mostly, though, the movie is about men. The two men at the story's engaging center are Carter Duryea (Mr. Grace), a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of Sports America. The man whom Carter is meant to make redundant is the 51-year-old Dan Foreman, a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone. Dan has a picture-perfect family and is the kind of unabashedly old-fashioned masculine type that Mr. Quaid has been slow-cooking to perfection over the years and which, on American screens at least, has lately gone missing.  DARGIS    'LOST EMBRACE' Starring Daniel Hendler. Directed by Daniel Burman (not rated, 100 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). Set in a shabby Buenos Aires shopping mall, this antic, melancholy comedy gives a Latin American twist to a story of young, male Jewish identity crisis that will be familiar to fans of Philip Roth, Neil Simon and Woody Allen. Ariel (the fast-moving, nervous-looking Mr. Hendler) is a young man in a hurry, without much of a sense of direction. He carries on an anxious affair with an older woman, pines for his former girlfriend, and fantasizes about emigrating to Poland, from which his family fled two generations before. Mostly, though, he is haunted by the absence of his father, Elias, who abandoned him as a baby to go to Israel to fight in the 1973 war. The film, while busy and diffuse, is also touching and funny, and its modesty and haphazardness are among its charms.  SCOTT    'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr. Wilson).  DARGIS    *'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R, 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent interpretation from Mr. Radford and a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that in evoking Velázquez, Rembrandt, Titian and Vermeer immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.  SCOTT    *'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliché, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio in 2004.  SCOTT    *'NOBODY KNOWS' Starring Yuya Yagira. . Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda (PG-13, 141 minutes; in Japanese, with English subtitles). Based on the true story of four children abandoned by their mother in a small Tokyo apartment, Mr. Kore-eda's fourth film is at once harrowing and tender, an urban horror story with overtones of fairy tale. Restricting himself to the children's point of view, the director creates an almost unbearable sense of dread in the audience; you can't help suspecting that, at every moment, something terrible is about to happen. But at the same time, because the children themselves do not perceive the full terribleness of their situation, the terror is mitigated by a sense of wonder and adventure. The keys to this meticulous and deeply humane film are Mr. Kore-eda's deft camera sense and the remarkable performance of the 12-year-old Mr. Yagira as Akira, the oldest of the four siblings, who must somehow preserve his own innocence while protecting his more vulnerable brother and sisters.  SCOTT    'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou, Gaspard Ulliel, Jean-Pierre Becker, Dominique Bettenfeld, Clovis Cornillac and Marion Cotillard. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trenchmate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, and directed by the cult favorite Jean-Pierre Jeunet, it follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiancé will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amélie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet possesses a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F.A.O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.  DARGIS    'THE WEDDING DATE' Starring Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney. Directed by Clare Kilner. (PG-13, 90 minutes). Either Ms. Kilner or Dana Fox, her screenwriter, must have adored ''Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' because their new romantic comedy struggles from beginning to end to capture that earlier film's charm and ebullience. Their efforts are largely unsuccessful. Ms. Messing stars as Kat Ellis, a New Yorker en route to London for her younger half-sister's wedding. Since there is no man in Kat's life, she turns to the classified ads for male escorts. In a fantasy worthy of ''Pretty Woman,'' the male prostitute she hires turns out to be a hunk (Mr. Mulroney) with beautiful manners and a degree in comparative literature from Brown. Both stars are highly appealing, despite a shaky script with aphorisms that don't quite deliver. After rowdy parties in London, everyone heads for the glorious English countryside for family-bonding activities. ''The Wedding Date'' proves that there is nothing inherently magical about a group of adults frolicking on a lawn with an old pop-music hit in the background. What charms it does have would be far more enjoyable if the movie weren't so in love with its own supposed cuteness.  GATES.    'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.

Sunday afternoon as part of the Let's Zydeco series, with dance lessons at 1:30 and music at 2; admission is $22.  PARELES    SANDRA COLLINS, Avalon, 662 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)807-7780. Ms. Collins tends toward clean, energetic progressive-house tracks, letting misty atmospherics and grand synthesizers glide over precise rhythm tracks. Tomorrow night after 10, with Pete Tong, Eyal Hen and Eddie Lee; admission is $30.  KELEFA SANNEH    *BO DIDDLEY/GENYA RAVAN, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42d Street, (212) 997-4144. When Bo Diddley plays his namesake beat and growls the metaphysical boasts of ''Who Do You Love,'' it's easy to hear the fire and syncopation that made him a rock pioneer. Behind them is a profound education in the blues. Genya Ravan, who sang with the band Ten Wheel Drive and was a pioneering female rock producer, opens the show. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $30 in advance, $35 tomorrow.  PARELES    *THOMAS FEHLMAN, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. Mr. Fehlman, a German producer, has been tinkering with electronic beats since the 1980's. Last year he released ''Lowflow'' (Plug Research), a warm CD full of minimalist pulses and languid breakbeats. Tonight at midnight; admission is $5.  SANNEH    *HEART & SOUL VALENTINE'S CONCERT, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)247-0200. This is the kind of concert where the audience seems likely to outperform the performers. Not that there's anything wrong with the veteran R&B acts scheduled to appear. The lineup includes Harold Melvin's Blue Notes, Ted Mills (formerly of Blue Magic), Meli'sa Morgan and, perhaps best of all, Staten Island's Force M.D.'s, who were combining smooth R&B with bumpy hip-hop long before it was as popular (or, as the members probably know all too well, as lucrative) as it is today. Still the real thrill will probably be the crowd full of quiet men and notably unquiet women, clutching roses and drinks and -- if the singers are doing their job right -- one another. Tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $45, and you might as well obey the fliers and ''dress to impress.''  SANNEH    *NORMAN JAY, APT, 419 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 414-4245. One of Britain's most popular D.J.'s comes to this cozy (that's a euphemism) nightclub in support of ''Good Times 4'' (Resist), a laid-back double-disc compilation put together by Norman Jay and his brother, Joey Jay. Expect a night of elegant funk, in the broadest sense -- the compilation includes appearances by everyone from the reggae act Zap Pow to the big band overseen by the British electronica producer Matthew Herbert. Tomorrow night after 10, with Citizen Kane; tickets are $8.  SANNEH    KOOL KEITH, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144. Kool Keith is hip-hop's definition of multiple personality syndrome, from his days with the Ultramagnetic M.C.'s to more recent metamorphoses into Dr. Octagon and Reverand Tom. Depending on his chosen role, he could be rapping comedy, science or smut. Tonight at 11; tickets are $20.  PARELES    KITKA, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)576-1155. The drones, dissonances and eerie beauty of Eastern European women's vocal music are the province of Kitka, which has been singing them since 1979. Tonight at 7:30; tickets are $20.  PARELES    *JENS LEKMAN/THE IMPOSSIBLE SHAPES/PARKER & LILY/THE SILENT LEAGUE, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700. Pop gets twisted in highly personal ways on this quadruple bill. Jens Lekman, a Swedish songwriter whose lyrics are in English, writes wistful ditties that can be wry or depressive. The Impossible Shapes look back to the psychedelically warped pop of the late 1960's, while Parker & Lily sing slowly and quietly about the wreckage of romance in reverberant arrangements. Brian Wilson's legacy shimmers through the songs of the Silent League, which uses a handful of musicians to create grandly expansive orchestral pop. Tomorrow night at 8:30; tickets are $10.  PARELES    LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO QUEEN: NO TIME FOR LOSERS, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212)533-2680. Joe McGinty and his coterie of songwriting connoisseurs first applied themselves to the mixture of hard-rock grandiosity and campy arrogance that was Queen five years ago. They're back at it, with ingenious ways to reinterpret the multitracked splendors of songs like ''Bohemian Rhapsody.'' Tonight at 8; admission is $25. Tomorrow night at 7, admission is $25; tomorrow night at 10:30, admission is $20.  PARELES    *ENRIQUE MORENTE/TOMATITO, Carnegie Hall, 881 Seventh Avenue, at 57th Street, (212)247-7800. This concert brings together two musicians who combine flamenco's austere tradition of volatile, smoldering passion with the urge to reinvent it. Enrique Morente is a singer who has reached back to old styles and also looked outside the tradition for forms and texts, from a flamenco Mass to rock fusions. This time, he will be in a more traditional format, collaborating with the remarkable guitarist Tomatito, whose improvising vocabulary includes both the deepest flamenco and the harmonies of jazz. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $22 to $69.  PARELES    ERICK MORILLO, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212)629-9000. This veteran house producer may still be best known for producing the huge 1993 hit ''I Like to Move It,'' but since then he's established himself as one of New York's most popular D.J.'s, known for raucous, clattering sets that sometimes gesture toward his love of Latin music. This party celebrates his new release, a four-disc set called ''The 2 Sides of My World'' (Subliminal), which includes both original productions (one track, ''Dance I Said,'' features P. Diddy) and D.J. mixes. Tonight after 10; tickets are $30 in advance, more at the door.  SANNEH    JOHNNY PACHECO/LA SONORA PONCEÑA/TITO ROJAS, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, (212) 239-2672. The flutist and bandleader Johnny Pacheco was born in the Dominican Republic but fell in love early with Afro-Cuban music. He has been a prime mover in New York Latin music since the 1960's, when he helped start Fania Records; he went on to lead the Fania All-Stars, the band that defined New York salsa. La Sonora Ponceña has been one of the cornerstones of Puerto Rican salsa since it was founded in 1954. Its arrangements are at once transparent and propulsive, with pinpoint horns, percussion and keyboard behind ardent vocals; they have urged more than one generation of dancers into motion. Tito Rojas has been one of the leading Puerto Rican salsa singers since the 1980's, making hits with both ballads and dance tunes. Tomorrow night from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m.; admission is $25.  PARELES    *SMOKEY AND MIHO/CHOCOLATE GENIUS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-7503. Miho Hatori sang and wrote songs for the funk-rap-lounge band Cibo Matto; Smokey Hormel has played guitar with Tom Waits and Beck. Leading a band, they delve into -- what else? -- Brazilian music. They're joined for this show, a benefit for Tonic, by the percussionist Cyro Baptista and the drummer Billy Martin from Medeski, Martin and Wood. Marc Anthony Thompson, aka Chocolate Genius, writes desolate, telling, unsparing songs about goodbyes, from doomed romances to senile parents. With his husky voice and the backup of Marc Ribot on guitar, he'll have twilit ballads and, probably, some droll comments in between. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $20.  PARELES    MARCO ANTONIO SOLÍS/ANA GABRIEL, Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)465-6741. Latin pop lives for love songs, and this pre-Valentine's Day ''Concierto del Amor'' presents two Mexican ballad singers who wholeheartedly revel in romance. Marco Antonio Solís is suave and earnest in his yearning songs, while Ana Gabriel pours drama into songs with a streak of tragedy. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $59.50 to $99.50.  PARELES    SOULIVE, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)230-0236. Soulive is an organ-guitar-drums trio that harks back to the 1950's and 1960's, playing meaty, blues-centered jazz for dancers who like straightforward funk. Lately, it has been hooking up with a little hip-hop. Tonight at 9; tickets are $25.  PARELES    SUPER DIAMOND, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800. A tribute to the songs of Neil Diamond, particularly his triumphal 1970's material. Smirking is optional. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $26.  PARELES    *KEITH SWEAT, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070. For the not-getting-any-younger slow-jam specialist Keith Sweat, every other weekend of the year must be merely preparation for this one -- no matter what else happens (or doesn't happen) in his career, he'll probably always be a big draw around Valentine's Day. Expect an audience full of longtime fans to scream and whoop for a set full of plaintive (but never, ever wimpy) love songs, sung by a man who knows how to find a balance between tenderness and rakishness. Sunday night at 7:30, with Atlantic Starr and Meli'sa Morgan; tickets are $53.50 to $73.50.  SANNEH    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    RUTH BROWN, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212)308-9455. This rhythm-and-blues legend has weathered one personal disaster after another, but misfortunes that might have silenced a less determined performer have only added dimension to Ms. Brown's already larger-than-life musical personality. Exhibiting a flamboyant showmanship that recalls her peer James Brown, she proudly presents herself as an indomitable member of royalty and stylistic descendant of the Queen of the Blues herself, Dinah Washington. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30, and Sunday night at 8. Cover: $50; no minimum.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212)419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant red-headed musician and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer, with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $42 at 8, with a $15 minimum. (An $80 dinner-and-show package is available.)  HOLDEN    *BLOSSOM DEARIE, Danny's Skylight Room, 346 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212)265-8133. To watch this singer and pianist is to appreciate the power of a carefully deployed pop-jazz minimalism combined with a highly discriminating taste in songs. She remains the definitive interpreter, at once fey and tough, of the pop-jazz satirist Dave Frishberg, as astute and unforgiving a social critic as exists. The songs -- her own and other people's -- date from all periods of a career remarkable for its longevity and for Ms. Dearie's stubborn independence and sly wit, which have never gone stale. Tomorrow night at 7; Sunday night at 6:15. Cover: $25, with a $15 minimum; a $54.50 dinner-and-show package is available.  HOLDEN    UTE LEMPER, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212)570-7189. This imperious, Dietrichesque cabaret singer, who is performing with a pop quartet through Feb. 26, lends the entire nightclub enterprise a German Expressionist seriousness. If her latest show is entirely different from the program of original songs she performed last year at Le Jazz au Bar, its attitude is similar. Most of the material doesn't deal directly with politics, history and literature, like the sprawling topical broadsides of the earlier show. But she still invests it with a ferocity that infuses the art (and artifice) of cabaret with an unrelenting dramatic intensity. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $65; $40 at the bar; no minimum.  HOLDEN    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    ERIC ALEXANDER QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212)864-6662. A young tenor saxophonist with a beautiful sound, centering in the Coltrane-ish lower-middle register; if he is a little unabashedly entranced by a particular area of jazz's past, around 1955 to 1965, he does well by it. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9, 10:30 and midnight; cover charge is $25.  BEN RATLIFF    RASHIED ALI QUARTET, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Best known as John Coltrane's drummer in his last few years and his foil on the duet album ''Interstellar Space,'' Mr. Ali has never stopped collaborating with up-and-coming musicians. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    J.D. ALLEN TRIO PLAYS THE MUSIC OF BUTCH MORRIS, Louis, 649 East Ninth Street, at Avenue C, East Village, (212)673-1190. J.D. Allen, an able young tenor saxophonist who has played with Betty Carter, Cindy Blackman, Eric Revis and others, is doing his part in Butch Morris's month-long ''Black February'' series of nightly performances. He's playing in most of the large improvising ensembles conducted by Mr. Morris through the month, and he's also playing this weekly gig with his own trio. On the music stand will be Mr. Morris's own compositions going back to the 1970's, which graced a number of old David Murray albums. They're powerfully appealing melodies; it's been too long since they've been heard. Tomorrow night at 8:30 pm; free admission.  RATLIFF    COOPER-MOORE/WILLIAM PARKER, Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center /LES Gallery, 107 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4080. The multi-instrumentalist Cooper-Moore needs no special context to be understood: he plays as if he is trying to grab the attention of pedestrians on a busy street. He'll play boogie-woogie piano, pushing form into abstraction; stamp out a rhythm with hand percussion; play beautiful ballads with home-made harps, or bark out a blues on the harmonica. This performance celebrates a Cooper-Moore boxed set, on the 50 Miles of Elbow Room label, which includes five seven-inch records and a booklet inside a small cedar box. It includes solo performances by Cooper-Moore and and William Parker on bass, and a duet between the two musicians. Sunday from 3 to 6 p.m; admission is $6.  RATLIFF    GOLD SPARKLE BAND, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue between Metropolitan and North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934. The Gold Sparkle Band has been in New York since the late 80's; it channels the East-Coast jazz avant-garde of the mid-1960's. Sunday night at 10; free admission.  RATLIFF    LEE KONITZ TRIO, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, midtown, (212)581-3080. Lee Konitz, the alto saxophonist, was one of Lennie Tristano's closest associates in the late 1940's and early 50's; that experience left a permanent impression on his subsequent career, in terms of repertory, instrumentation and many other things. Even so, he is as original a player as there is in jazz, with a sound that has remained limpid and innocent and an emphasis on melody that makes him always easy to follow. He plays this weekend with the brothers Ed and George Schuller, on bass and drums. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    JASON LINDNER GROUP, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1073. Jason Lindner, a smart, rhythmic pianist who brings together bop, Cuban and all sorts of progressive influences, has become a regular feature at this club; this particular group includes the bassist Reggie Washington, the drummer Tony Escapa, and as guests, the saxophonist Jimmy Vass and the singer Baba Israel. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.  RATLIFF    SERGIO MENDES, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212)475-8592. Three decades before Bebel Gilberto could be heard in restaurants all across the country, Sergio Mendes was the populist face of Brazilian music, making albums that souped up bossa nova for international audiences. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $40 at the tables, $30 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.  RATLIFF    *BUTCH MORRIS, Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue between Metropolitan Avenue and North Third Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934; Belt Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 563-0487; Bowery Poetry Club, 308 Bowery, East Village, (212)614-0505. Butch Morris has set up performances every night during February; he's calling it ''Black February,'' and this month officially celebrates 20 years of Mr. Morris's ''conductions,'' performances in which he conducts groups of improvisers, jazz or otherwise, with his own language of signals and baton movements. He's playing with different ensembles each night, and here's the weekend schedule: with Butchlandband at Zebulon, tonight at 10 and midnight; free admission; with the 18 piece Free Zone/Sound Infusion Orchestra tomorrow at 4 pm at the Belt Theater; admission is $10; with the New York Skyscraper Ensemble Sunday at 5 and 6 p.m., at Bowery Poetry Club; admission is $12. Check his Web site, www.conduction.us, for further information on these and other performances.  RATLIFF    HOUSTON PERSON QUARTET, Lenox Lounge, 288 Lenox Avenue near 125th Street, Harlem, (212)427-0253. A veteran tenor saxophonist who keeps things pleasurable. His background is in the 1950's, when a good deal of jazz was completely submerged in rhythm and blues, and he is one of the few mainstream jazz performers today who can routinely find access to the deep language of pleasure from that time. Mr. Person has an elastic, sequential solo-building style that links him to Sonny Rollins and occasionally a fat, breathy tone that links him to Ben Webster. Enjoy him. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8:30, 10 and 11:30; cover charge is $20 per set, and there is a one-drink minimum.  RATLIFF    *BEN RILEY'S MONK LEGACY SEPTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, 5th Floor, (212)258-9595. Led by the drummer Ben Riley, who played regularly with Thelonious Monk through the 1960's, this seven-piece band will do something unusual: play new arrangements of Monk material with no pianist. Since Monk's songs bear up beautifully through any number of reinterpretations, and since Mr. Riley is a lovingly sensitive drummer, it should be a worthwhile week. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.  RATLIFF    *JIMMY SCOTT, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, midtown, (212) 582-2121. This singer of sepulchral jazz songs keeps rolling along, with the cracks and crevices in his voice seeming either more authentic or more disturbing, depending on your point of view. But he is also one of the old-school jazz performers who know how to hold audiences tightly from beginning to end. Sets through Sunday night are at 8:30 and 10:30; cover, $35, and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    JOE WILDER WITH MICHAEL WEISS TRIO, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212)885-7125. Mr. Wilder, a marvelous trumpeter who played with big bands in the 1940's and 50's and finally went full time into studio and television work, plays a kind of tabula-rasa swing language: there's very little slang in there to clog the music. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:45; cover charge is $15, and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    BUSTER WILLIAMS QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)255-4037. Mr. Williams, an agile bassist with a liquid tone, has been setting up bands stocked with the best players in New York. This one includes the saxophonist Steve Wilson, the pianist George Colligan and the drummer Lenny White. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    MATT WILSON'S ARTS AND CRAFTS, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Regardless of who's in his band -- and membership has changed several times over the last few years -- the jazz drummer Matt Wilson is a plenty good enough draw all by himself. Influenced by the late Billy Higgins, among others, Mr. Wilson's style swings with a fairly light touch; but he is fiendishly attentive to what his sidemen are doing, and he uses every bit they give him, playing off their gestures, stoking their furnaces in turn. He has a sense of play that's hard to miss. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, and $20 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent music performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'ARIANNA IN CRETA' With first-rate production values as well as musical ones devoted to professional revivals of virtually unknown works, the Gotham Chamber Opera can claim to be the pre-eminent small opera company in New York. This season is practically mainstream by the company's standards as it jumps onto the bandwagon of the current Handel fad with a work from the composer's prime (1734), the first in a planned series of Ariadne-themed operas. The cast includes some notable young singers, Caroline Worra and Hanan Alattar among them; the conductor is the company's founder, Neal Goren; Christopher Alden will direct. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Henry Street Settlement, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212)279-4200. Tickets: $30 to $60.  ANNE MIDGETTE    'LA BOHÈME' It's been some time since the Metropolitan Opera's crowd-pleasing production of Puccini's ''Bohème'' has held much interest for adventurous opera buffs. But this season's revival offers an impressive and intriguing cast. The golden-voiced coloratura soprano Ruth Ann Swenson continues her exploration of the rich lyric soprano repertory as she sings the role of Mimi, with the hardy tenor Roberto Aronica as Rodolfo. The vibrant soprano Patricia Racette sings Musetta, with the robust baritone Dwayne Croft as her off-again, on-again boyfriend Marcello. Daniel Oren conducts. Tomorrow at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212)362-6000. Sold out; returned tickets may be available at the box office.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    Classical Music    AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA Leon Botstein and his American Symphony Orchestra keep coming at us with irresistible repertory. Sunday afternoon brings the orchestra's latest adventure into French opera: ''Le Roi Malgré Lui'' by Chabrier. This comedy for the opera stage will be performed at Avery Fisher Hall, and anyone interested in the byways of this strain of opera should try to go -- either for love or just curiosity. Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $53.  BERNARD HOLLAND    BARGEMUSIC There are few better places to hear chamber music in New York than this floating concert hall on the Brooklyn side of the East River. Once a coffee barge, it offers the intimacy that chamber music demands, as well as a wonderful view of lower Manhattan through the bay windows that make up the back wall of the stage. This weekend, Mark Peskanov, the violinst and Bargemusic's executive and artistic director, presides over performances of two Mozart Divertimentos -- those in B flat (K. 287) and D (K. 334). The performers, along with Mr. Peskanov, include Aaron Boyd, violinist; Miranda Sielaff, violist; Eric Jacobsen, cellist; Timothy Cobb, bassist, and Wei-Ping Chou and Brad Gemeinhardt, hornists. Tonight and tomorrow nights at 7:30, and Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083. Tickets: $40; $25 for students.  ALLAN KOZINN    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER Ravel was a big admirer of jazz and couldn't understand why more American classical composers did not integrate it into their music. The composer himself suggested how it might be done in his catchy jazz-tinged Violin Sonata, to be performed at this concert by the fine French violinist Philippe Graffin and the pianist André-Michel Schub. Paul Neubauer (viola) and Gary Hoffman (cello) join for the remainder of the French-themed program, including music by Fauré and Saint-Saens. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875.5788. Tickets: $27.50 to $48.  JEREMY EICHLER    COLUMBIA SINFONIETTA This ambitious group was founded in 2000 to address a perceived dearth of larger scale New York ensembles devoted exclusively to contemporary music. The group closed up shop after one season but it has recently re-formed under its previous director, the conductor and percussionist Jeffrey Milarsky, to pick up where it left off presenting both ''classic'' works of recent decades that are rarely heard in New York, and new compositions. In the former category this weekend will be Messiaen's ''Oiseaux Exotiques,'' an important piece from the mid-1950's that is derived, like so much of the composer's music, from bird songs. Also on the program will be a 1979 percussion work by Michael Finnissy as well as more recent music by Carlos Sánchez-Gutiérrez, David Rakowski and Eric Chasalow. Sunday at 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330. Tickets: $10.  EICHLER    *SHARON ISBIN Guitarists typically build their performances around either solo works, concertos or chamber music. Sharon Isbin, one of the finest guitarists performing now, both technically and interpretively, will draw on all three repertories in her concert on Sunday. She opens with Vivaldi's Concerto in D (RV 93), and closes with a chamber score, the Boccherini Quintet in D (G. 448). Between them, she offers an arrangement by John Duarte of the Albinoni Adagio, Mr. Duarte's own ''Joan Baez Suite'' in its New York premiere, Falla's ''Siete Canciones Populares Españolas'' and Rodrigo's ''Aranjuez ma pensée.'' Ms. Isbin's collaborators include Catherine Cho and Soovin Kim, violinists; Cynthia Phelps, violist; Carter Brey, cellist, and Daniel Druckman, percussionist. Sunday at 3, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212)415-5500. Tickets: $40.  KOZINN    MET CHAMBER ENSEMBLE A few seasons ago, Dawn Upshaw joined James Levine and the Met Chamber Ensemble -- players from the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra -- in remarkably sensual, eloquent rendering of Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire.'' Ms. Upshaw returns to sing the work again with Mr. Levine and company in an all-contemporary program that also includes Luigi Dallapiccola's ''Piccola Musica Notturna,'' Elliott Carter's ''Luimen'' and Schoenberg's own chamber arrangement of his Five Pieces (Op. 16). Sunday at 5, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $48 to $64.  KOZINN    NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC In his last years with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam, an ensemble with a great Mahler tradition, Riccardo Chailly was becoming a formidable Mahlerian. Now, in the first of his two weeks with the New York Philharmonic, an orchestra with its own personal connection to the composer, Mr. Chailly conducts Mahler's Seventh Symphony. And a fuller exposure to Mr. Chailly as a Mahlerian can be had in a recording of the Ninth Symphony with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, released late last year by Decca. Today at 2 p.m., tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: today, $22 to $74; tomorrow and Tuesday, $25 to $90.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    JOSÉ VAN DAM Both in opera and in the song repertory, the Belgian bass-baritone José Van Dam has been among the most vocally splendid and artistically refined singers of our time. A few seasons back, as Mr. Van Dam turned 60, his voice, understandably, showed signs of decline. But in the last two years he has gained new-found vocal vitality, most recently as Golaud in the Metropolitan Opera's production of Debussy's ''Pelléas et Mélisande.'' At 64 he is singing with uncanny freshness and incomparable artistry. His recital, the first of two programs for Lincoln Center's ''Art of the Song'' series, should be marvelous. With the pianist Maciej Pikulski, he will sing French works by Fauré, Debussy, Massenet, Berlioz and Bizet. (The second program is on Wednesday) Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)721-6500. Tickets: $48.  TOMMASINI    'GAY VALENTINE MUSIC CELEBRATION' Tomorrow night Canticorum Virtuosi, the nonprofit organization that oversees the activities of two respected area choruses, the New York Virtuoso Singers and the Canticum Novum Singers, presents an elaborate and eclectic concert to honor ''same-sex love and affection,'' to quote the presenters. The distinguished and varied roster of performers includes the composer and pianist David Del Tredici, the Paul Taylor Dance Company, the tenor John Wesley Wright, the Gay Gotham Chorus, the Ambassador Singers of the New York City Gay Men's Chorus, a roster of cabaret performers and Harold Rosenbaum directing the Canticum Novum Singers and the New York Virtuoso Singers. The program is a benefit for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS. Tomorrow night at 8, Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-7171. Tickets: $20 to $100.  TOMMASINI    NIKOLAI MEDTNER This Russian pianist and composer, who died in 1951, is no longer a household name, but his passionate supporters during his lifetime included Rachmaninoff, who in 1912 labeled him ''the most talented of all the modern composers.'' Medtner's late-Romantic solo and chamber works are the focus of a program tonight that, with David Dubal as host, features a selection of piano miniatures or ''Skazki'' (''fairytales'') as well as his Piano Quintet in C, among other works. Tonight at 8, Renee Weiler Concert Hall, Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212)242-4770. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and 65+.  EICHLER    ORLANDO CONSORT Among the challenges of performing very old music are, first, figuring out how it went and, second, making it come alive. Both challenges are grist for the mill of this male vocal quartet, founded in 1988 (but recently joined by a new tenor), celebrated for its performances of music written before 1500, and supported by musicologists in preparing varied programs like this weekend's, which includes music from their latest album, devoted to the 15th-century composer Antoine Busnois. Other star composers -- stars, at least, to specialists in this particular area -- are Hayne van Ghizeghem, Walter Lambe and Henry VIII. Tomorrow night at 8, Low Library Rotunda at Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212)854-7799. Tickets: $35; $21 for students.  MIDGETTE    TOKYO STRING QUARTET The Tokyo String Quartet is currently in residence at the 92d Street Y, and the theme of the series of concerts it has been performing is immigrant composers. Tomorrow's program consists of the ''Rider'' Quartet from Haydn's Op. 74, Zemlinski's Fourth Quartet and Hanns Eisler's Septet No. 2 with added flute, piccolo, clarinet and bassoon. Viewing Haydn as an immigrant stretches the point. The Op. 74 may have coincided with his famous visits to London, but that is all. Still Haydn is always welcome regardless of passport status. Zemlinski and Eisler, who ended up back in East Germany, are legitimate topics. Tomorrow night at 8, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212)415-5500. Tickets: $35.  HOLLAND    Dance    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance.    BEIJING MODERN DANCE COMPANY A troupe founded in 1995 and one of the principal forces in contemporary Chinese dance makes its New York debut in ''Rear Light,'' an evening-long work to music by Pink Floyd that reflects the struggle of a young Chinese generation to reconcile traditional culture with influences from abroad and a thirst for intellectual freedom. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-0800. Tickets: $34.  JACK ANDERSON    AKIM FUNK BUDDHA The ever-exuberant Mr. Buddha (or is it Funk Buddha?) specializes in dance-theater that combines unblinking stillness, storytelling, tap and Mongolian throat-singing. He adds martial arts, breakdancing, beat-boxing, and Japanese, Zulu and urban English talk to the mix in his new ''Amazulu: Dance as a Weapon: the Hip-Hop Circus -- Part I.'' Tonight and tomorrow (and next Thursday through Saturday) at 10 p.m.; Sunday (and next Sunday) at 5:30 p.m. La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, west of Second Avenue, Manhattan, (212)475-7710 or www.lamama.org. Tickets: $15.  JENNIFER DUNNING    'BUTTER MELTS AWAY MY LETTERS' Choreographed by Stephanie Rafferty and conceived and directed by Gian Marco Lo Forte, this theater-dance piece visits a group of young runaways to New York City who cannot quite shrug off the past. Tonight and tomorrow (and Thursdays through Saturdays through Feb. 26) at 8 p.m.; Sunday (and Sundays through Feb. 27) at 2:30 and 8 p.m., La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street west of Second Avenue, Manhattan (212) 475-7710. Tickets: $15; TDF vouchers accepted.  DUNNING    *FLAMENCO FESTIVAL The festival closes with ''Flamenco at the Crossroads,'' in which the dancer Rafaela Carrasco will join traditional and new-style flamenco singers in an exploration of this age-old Gypsy art. Sunday at 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212)247-7800. Tickets: $22 to $69. And for those who wish to continue the exploration, there is a free series saluting the great Spanish filmmaker Carlos Saura and his flamenco films, many made with Antonio Gades, ending on Feb. 23 with Mr. Saura's classic, all-encompassing ''Flamenco.'' Wednesdays beginning at 6 p.m. Instituto Cervantes, 211-215 East 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)308-7720 or www.cervantes.org.  DUNNING    'I LOVE TANGO' This ''tango musical'' boasts four dancers and live string, bandoneon, piano and vocal music. Tonight (and Thursdays and Fridays through March 25) at 8 p.m.; tomorrow (and Saturdays through March 26) at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays (through March 27) at 4 p.m., Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718)729-3880 or www.thaliatheatre.org. Tickets: $30; $27 for students and 65+; $25 (on Thursdays).  DUNNING    MARK JARECKE A choreographer who has studied philosophy as well as dance and whose creations often have an architectural quality offers ''Dendron,'' an in-the-round piece during which the audience is free to move around the performance area. Theatergoers are also encouraged to bring portable radios with earphones to savor the shifts in the sound environment by Chris Peck and Jon Moniaci. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 8:30, Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at Tenth Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.  ANDERSON    CLEO MACK DANCE PROJECT Ms. Mack and her New Jersey-based company specialize in modern dance that she describes as ''highly choreographed life.'' The program includes new and recent dances that explore emotional states and one in which a 30-foot long skirt is a character. Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, Manhattan, (908)561-5454. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    MOISEYEV DANCE COMPANY Russia's most famous folk-dance troupe makes its only New York appearance this season. Founded in 1936 by Igor Moiseyev, who at 98 continues to choreograph, the company is known for its spirited acrobatic dancing, theatrical flair and a repertory of works from Russia and many European and Asian nations. The dancing world travelers also perform American jazz and rock pieces. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, Brooklyn College, near Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, Brooklyn, (718)951-4500. Tickets: $45, $40.  ANDERSON    PARSONS DANCE COMPANY The program includes four modern-dance pieces by David Parsons, a former Paul Taylor star, and music by the Ahn Trio, a group of three Korean-born sisters. Tonight at 8, Tilles Center for the Performing Arts, C.W. Post Campus, Long Island University, Route 25A, Brookville, (516)299-3100 or www.tillescenter.org. Tickets: $38, $50 and $60; $35; $47 and $57 (65+).  DUNNING    ROCHA DANCE THEATER This program of modern-dance choreography by Jenny Rocha and the guest artist Kelli Wicke Davis, explores hidden human behavior, in part to music by Marty Beller. It includes -- we like this -- a piece with interactive newspaper costumes. Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m., Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, Manhattan, (212)334-7479. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    THUNDERBIRD AMERICAN INDIAN DANCERS Dances of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Inuit, Hop and Pueblo peoples will be included in this 30th annual Pow-Wow, along with a new modern-dance piece by Tom Pearson, a Creek Cherokee. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 5 p.m., Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue at Tenth Street, Manhattan (212) 254-1109. Tickets: $10; $1 for children under 12 accompanying ticket-bearing adults on Sunday.  DUNNING    'WAVE OF HUMANITY' This four-part, eight-hour dance event, a benefit for tsunami relief efforts, features nearly 40 individuals and companies chosen by nine dance institutions.

Tickets: $20 (first through third parts); $15 (fourth part); $60 for all four; $100 VIP tickets for all four.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    'CONTEMPORARY VOICES: WORKS FROM THE UBS ART COLLECTION.' Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9400, through April 25. What's wrong with this picture? The Museum of Modern Art, the most visionary museum of the 20th century, is inaugurating the temporary-exhibition galleries in its 21st-century home with an exhibition of gifts from a corporate collection. It is an ambitious, carefully selected corporate collection, but that doesn't keep the ensemble from feeling corporate, monotonous and by-the-book. The 40 (of 64) works given or promised to the Modern are nearly all by white, male artists and they are all already represented in the collection. There's nothing wrong with the individual works by artists like Philip Guston, Jasper Johns and Vija Celmins that won't be cured by integrating them into the Modern's collection, but the ensemble effect is dispiriting. With an emphasis on a narrow swath of the 1980's mainstream, the show feels like an excessively edited letter in a bottle from an art world that no longer exists. Hours: Saturdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m.; closed Tuesdays. Admission: $20; $16 for 65+; $12 for students. Free on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m.  ROBERTA SMITH    'RUTH DUCKWORTH, MODERNIST SCULPTOR,' Museum of Arts and Design, 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535, through April 3. A sculptor whose basic medium is clay, Ms. Duckworth makes everything from tiny, delicate vessels to monumental outdoor sculptures. Though her work fits in -- but not too neatly -- with the modernist tradition, her eye has roamed everywhere, resulting in a bewildering variety of styles and influences, from Brancusi to a beef bone found in her soup. Sometimes the influences combine awkwardly, making her work seem a little strained and quirky, but often enough her venturesomeness pays off, producing images of eloquence and power. Hours: Daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursdays: 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $9; $6 for 65+ and students. Thursdays from 6 to 8 p.m. is pay what you wish.  GRACE GLUECK    *'FROM FILIPPO LIPPI TO PIERO DELLA FRANCESCA: FRA CARNEVALE AND THE MAKING OF A RENAISSANCE MASTER,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710, through May 1. The Italian Renaissance artist-priest known as Fra Carnevale was an art-world somebody in his day, but a shadowy figure to modern historians, known primarily for two extraordinary paintings of tiny figures in fantastic architectural settings. Both paintings are in this intricate think-piece of a show that tries to reconstruct his career by bringing his known paintings together. At the same time, it uses his work, along with that of major figures like Filippo Lippi and Piero della Francesca, to explore larger ideas about self-created professional identity in a cultural epoch far more diverse than it is sometimes thought to have been. A few of the paintings mustered as evidence are pretty strange; many are glorious. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65+, $10; students, $7.  HOLLAND COTTER    'IMAGES OF DON QUIXOTE: THE ART OF ILLUSTRATION AND PRINTMAKING,' the Hispanic Society of America, 613 West 155th Street, (212)926-2234, through Feb. 20. A few years back, a poll of international writers voted ''Don Quixote'' the greatest book of all time. This year Cervantes's novel is four centuries old, and the Hispanic Society of America is celebrating the occasion with this exhibition of illustrations of the story printed from the 17th through 20th centuries. Despite its small size, the show demonstrates how attitudes toward the book changed in different eras, from raucous comedy to Romantic tragedy. And in designs by artists like John Vanderbank, Fragonard and Gustave Doré, there are fascinating images and ideas to consider. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 4 p.m. Free.  COTTER    'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718)638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was one of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.  KEN JOHNSON    Galleries: Uptown    MIQUEL BARCELÓ, C&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212)861-0020, through March 5. Paint as a natural force is the consuming interest of Mr. Barceló, a Spanish artist steeped in a grand realist tradition. His feeling for the past includes an admiration for the lush Spanish still lifes known as bodegónes. But his abstract-figurative use of paint, in thick impasto crusts and slathers, is also indebted to the dense pigment-plus canvases of post-World War II idols like Jackson Pollock, Antoni Tapiès, and Jean Dubuffet. His surfaces are often bulked up with vegetative matter, sand and other materials to suggest natural surfaces like the sea and its inner life.  GLUECK    Galleries: 57th Street    'LEON POLK SMITH: FORMS AND FUNCTIONS,' Washburn, 20 West 57th Street, (212)397-6780, through March 5. Spaces and their boundaries fascinated this hard-edge abstractionist (1906-1996) and in this show of his biomorphic paintings from the 1950's his elegantly calculated contrivance of one space impinging on another pleasingly asks the eye to tease out figure-ground relationships. In ''Over Easy,'' a large, partly heart-shaped figure of mauve thrusts on to a black ground at an angle; or is it the curvy black space that cuts into the aggressor? Smith's clean, flat surfaces, each restricted to two colors, are shown with examples of sleek, minimal contoured furniture by front-line designers of the period, Charles and Ray Eames and Isamu Noguchi among them. The biomorphic shapes of the furniture and their colors play nicely off Smith's snart, snappy formats.  GLUECK    'VIEW EIGHT: A FEW DOMESTIC OBJECTS INTERROGATE A FEW WORKS OF ART,' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212)752-2929, through Feb. 26. This canny show of artworks and objects of design includes Josiah McElheny's curvy mirrored coffee table bearing mirrored blobby objects; beautiful blobby ceramic sculptures by Ken Price; delicate, biomorphic hanging lights by Lionel Theodore Dean; a twisted, retro-futuristic orange bench by Sachio Hihara; and, like the nightmare that domestic utopianism tries to insulate us from, one of Lee Bontecou's early, scarily militaristic reliefs.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    *'LOG CABIN,' Artists Space,38 Greene Street, (212)226-3970, through Feb. 26. Given the cultural climate, wedding bells won't be playing ''Over the Rainbow'' any time soon, and men and women won't be coming out of the closet and going into the Army. So what can Log Cabin Republicans, gay supporters of the ruling party, be thinking? This is one of the questions posed, however indirectly, by the 33 participants in a snappy, discursive group show that serves as field report on what art with queer identity as a theme is looking like these days. As surveyed by the curator, Jeffrey Uslip, it's looking good and heterogeneous: ambisexual, interracial and multigenerational, though short on lesbian artists, who are making some of the best work anywhere.  COTTER    'WHO IS THE PROTAGONIST?' Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, (212)625-9224, through Feb. 26. This engaging exhibition about approaches to storytelling includes a life-size space station interior handmade by Lisi Raskin; a Modernist theater environment with a mysterious sci-fi video called ''Moon Colony'' by Ohad Meromi, the show's organizer; a short, strange sci-fi story written by Halsey Rodman; a storyboard for a film about a father and his young son by Guy Ben-Ner; and a Pop-Cubist head of cut and painted paper by Ryan Johnson.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    KNUT ASDAM: 'FILTER CITY,' Gasser & Grunert, 524 West 19th Street, (212)807-9494, through Feb. 19. This Norwegian artist who has exhibited extensively in Europe presents a slow, enigmatic, 21-minute film about two young women -- one small and white, the other tall and black -- who, between long pauses, emit oracular, world-weary utterances about social issues and obscure personal concerns. It is well-produced and nice to watch, though it borders inadvertently on a parody of pretentious avant-garde filmmaking.  JOHNSON    SANTE D'ORAZIO: 'PAM: AMERICAN ICON,' Stellan Holm, 524 West 24th Street, (212) 627-7444, through March 5. Pamela Anderson -- yes, that Pamela Anderson -- in all her pneumatic, mostly unclothed glory is the subject of large and surrealistically vivid photographs that were originally commissioned but not published by Playboy magazine. Students: discuss criteria for judging the value -- aesthetic and otherwise -- of these artworks.  JOHNSON    JOHN LURIE, Roebling Hall, 606 West 26th Street, (212)929-8180, through Feb. 26. The stream-of-consciousness notational ink drawings and radiant gouaches of the musician John Lurie have precedents in the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat and William Wegman's early Conceptual drawings and maybe the cartoons of Roz Chast, but they have their own sense of wiry line and texture, wordplay, sexual bluntness and radiant color.  SMITH    NATARAJ SHARMA, Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, (212)989-7074, through Feb. 19. The first New York solo exhibition of this Indian painter who has exhibited internationally is too diverse to give a clear picture of what he is about, but the best works have an intriguing allegorical resonance. They are made in a neat and orderly style combining Pop, photo-based realism and hints of Indian traditionalism. Most impressive is the large picture in which a naked man peeps into a temple filled with an semiabstract orgy of interpenetrating pink bodies.  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    MATTHEW ANTEZZO, Maccarone, 45 Canal Street, (212)431-4977, through March 13. Among works by the artist known for deadpan copies of art magazine ads are nondescript penciled copies of photographs of feminist heroines like Bella Abzug and Gloria Steinem; copies in pencil of news photographs of American Indian protest events that took place in 1975; and a painting of an ancient statue of Diogenes of Sinope titled ''Cynic.'' What it all means could keep an undergraduate seminar busy for some time.  JOHNSON    NEW YORK'S FINEST, Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, through March 5. This exhibition of paintings by 19 mostly young and emerging artists has an eclectic, anarchic spirit. The common ground includes an interest in material, be it the store-bought fabric with which Joe Bradley conjures up a Minimalist seaman, or the Expressionist effusions of Anke Weyer and Wallace Whitney. Variations on a knowing but unjaded Pop-Expressionism prevail, mixed in varying ratios by Katherine Bernhardt, Brendan Cass, Bill Saylor, Carrie Moyer and Josh Smith, who has lately abandoned paper for canvas to good effect. ''Laissez-faire, but mean it!'' might be the collective rallying cry.  SMITH    Last Chance    'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)423-3500, closing on Sunday. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphosing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  COTTER    'COMIC GROTESQUE: WIT AND MOCKERY IN GERMAN ART, 1870-1940,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200, closing on Monday. The horrors of World War I are usually credited with inspiring the dark, often scathing humor that was used to comment on and combat some very unfunny developments in Germany in the first four decades of the century. But the Neue Galerie's splendidly multimedia revisionist show takes a broader view. It identifies paintings by Arnold Bocklin from the 1870's as a point of origin and then sweeps forward in a selective yet encompassing manner, touching on painting, poetry, graphic design and popular entertainment. It places artists like Lionel Feininger and Alfred Kubin in context. It culminates in the films of the great Karl Valentin, a star of stage, screen and cabaret who was Germany's Charlie Chaplin. Hours: Saturdays through Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7.  SMITH    CORY ARCANGEL, Team Gallery, 527 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-9219, closing tomorrow. In one of the season's best debuts, the collaboratively inclined Cory Arcangel and his cohorts create quasi-interactive sound and video pieces of startling and subversive beauty by commandeering various electronic or digital staples including music videos, karaoke tunes, video games, the Internet and even a long phone message. The sense that anything man-made is grist for personal expression is exhilarating.  SMITH    'ONE-ARMED BANDIT,' D'Amelio Terras, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)352-9460, closing tomorrow. This three-artist show is notable mainly for its playful installation. Presented in groups of three with each artwork framed by red tape applied to the wall, Polly Apfelbaum's gridded drawings of cartoon blossoms on white velvet, Tony Feher's flattened, glitter-covered found boxes and Joanne Greenbaum's buoyant abstract pictures are displayed in various permutations like slot machine icons.

Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212)239-6200.    'IN THE WINGS' Previews begin today. Opens Sept. 28. Peter Scolari stars in a new play by Stewart F. Lane about a young couple, both actors, who are cast in a musical. Directed by Jeremy Dobrish (2:00). Promenade Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212)239-6200.    'KISSING FIDEL'  Opens Sept. 20. A new comedy-drama by Eduardo Machado about a young man who goes back home to Cuba to kiss and forgive Fidel Castro. Directed by Michael John Garces (2:15). Kirk Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212)279-4200.    'THE LADIES OF THE CORRIDOR'  Opens Wednesday. The Peccadillo Theater Company revives Dorothy Parker and Arnaud d'Usseau's play about the eccentric residents of a New York City hotel (2:00). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212)279-4200.    'MIRACLE BROTHERS' Opens Sept. 18. An epic new musical by Kirsten Childs about the adventures of two brothers -- one black, one white -- in 17th-century Brazil (2:00). Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303.    'A NAKED GIRL ON THE APPIAN WAY' Previews begin Tuesday. Opens Oct. 6. Jill Clayburgh, Richard Thomas and Matthew Morrison star in the Roundabout Theater Company's production of Richard Greenberg's comedy about a couple, their two children and some surprising news (2:00). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)719-1300.    'THE PAVILION' Previews begin today. Opens Sept. 20. Stephen Bogardus, Brian D'Arcy James and Jennifer Mudge star in Craig Wright's play about romance at a Minnesota dance hall (2:00). Rattlestick Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212)868-4444.    'SLUT' Previews begin Tuesday. Opens Oct. 1. A hit at the 2003 Fringe Festival, Ben H. Winters and Stephen Sislen's musical is about two best friends and the rocker who comes between them (2:00). American Theater of Actors, 314 West 54th Street, Clinton, (212)(212)239-6200.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, this might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LENNON' In the immortal words of Yoko Ono, ''Aieeeee!'' (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt. (2:15). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JOY' John Fisher's play with music, a lecture-prone valentine to San Francisco and gay life among college students, says less about human sexuality and longing than the classic, melancholy love songs the cast performs (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Andrea Stevens)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately, the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters, despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint through Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    *'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an all-Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    Off Off Broadway    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101. (Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden, 252 West 45th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200.(Brantley)    'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4747. (Brantley)    'BLUE MAN GROUP' Conceptual art as entertainment (1:45). Astor Place Theater, 434 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)254-4370. (Brantley)    'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' The Shtetl Land pavilion in the theme park called Broadway (2:55). The Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'HAIRSPRAY' Fizzy pop, cute kids, large man in a housedress (2:30). Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'MOVIN' OUT' The miracle dance musical that makes Billy Joel cool (2:00). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100.(Brantley)    'NAKED BOYS SINGING' That's who they are. That's what they do (1:05). Julia Miles Theater, 414 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Anita Gates)    'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE PRODUCERS' The ne plus ultra of showbiz scams (2:45). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    *'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' Clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin are stirring up laughter and enjoyment. A show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, Flatiron district, (212)307-4100.(Van Gelder)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, Manhattan, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA' Three decades after it first charmed critics with its insouciance, John Guare and Mel Shapiro's adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy, with throwaway songs by Galt MacDermot, tastes less like vintage Champagne than a fruity sangria. But isn't sangria the right drink for a sultry night in the park? Directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, with a peppy young cast that includes the ravishing Rosario Dawson (2:45). The Public Theater at the Delacorte Theater, Central Park, entrances at 81st Street and Central Park West, and at 79th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212)239-6200, closing Sunday.

Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. (An article on summer films is on Page 1 of Weekend.)    *'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)    'ASYLUM' (R, 90 minutes) A dreary, claustrophobic soap, with Natasha Richardson, about a 1950's bored wife and mother victimized by her times and her incredibly bad taste in men; based on Patrick McGrath's novel and directed by David Mackenzie. (Manohla Dargis)    *'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs, and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of this 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Dargis)    'BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS' (No rating, 111 minutes, in Mandarin and French) Dai Sijie, adapting his novel, looks back at the Chinese Cultural Revolution, relating a touching, bittersweet love story that is also a testament to the power of literature in times of political repression. (Scott)    *'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)    'THE BAXTER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) A ''Baxter,'' in the lingo of this romantic comedy written by, directed by and starring the comedian Michael Showalter, is the safe choice, the also-ran, the guy who is left at the altar when the hero shows up, as Dustin Hoffman did in ''The Graduate,'' to claim his true love. The film's tragic flaw is that Mr. Showalter is miscast -- or has miscast himself -- in the title role. In the end, ''The Baxter'' is a Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet. (Dana Stevens)    * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    'THE BROTHERS GRIMM' (PG-13, 118 minutes) Despite a few early sparks of promise, Terry Gilliam's big-screen adventure about the brother folklorists (played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) sputters and coughs along like an unoiled machine, grinding gears and nerves in equal measure. (Dargis)    'THE CAVE' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In Bruce Hunt's formulaic ''Cave,'' a group of ace cave-divers are flown in to investigate an intricate maze system discovered beneath the ruins of an ancient Romanian abbey, but instead become the prey of mutated demonlike creatures that can fly and see in the dark. Dreadfully dull, muddled and chaotic, with colorless and underdeveloped characters.(Laura Kern)    'THE CENTURY OF THE SELF' (No rating, four hours, shown in two parts) This documentary, a four-part series produced for BBC television that is being shown in theaters in two separate two-hour segments, explores how Freud's seminal theory of the unconscious has been successfully deployed over the past century as an instrument of consumer manipulation and social control. ''The Century of the Self'' is an unusually cerebral filmed essay that demands focus and patience from its audience as it sets about unearthing a secret history of the 20th century. (Stevens)    'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)    *'THE CONSTANT GARDENER' (R, 129 minutes) A superior thriller with a conscience, from John le Carré's novel.( Scott)    *'DARWIN'S NIGHTMARE' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English, Russian and Swahili) A harrowing, unblinking look at the consequences of globalization, as seen from the shores of Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Not easy viewing, but indispensable for just that reason. (Scott)    'DEUCE BIGALOW: EUROPEAN GIGOLO' (R, 77 minutes) In a sequel to the 1999 hit, the schlubby escort lands in Amsterdam to make lovelorn ladies feel whole, but the entire ordeal is mockery disguised as self-help. This insulting comedy is out of step with the culture, the times and the rebranded Adam Sandler, who was a producer and bit player in this mess. (Ned Martel)    *'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael González (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela), is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)    'ETERNAL' (No rating, 108 minutes) Lush, lurid and completely besotted with itself, ''Eternal'' claims inspiration from the life of Erszebet Bathory, a 16th-century Hungarian countess whose antiaging routine required frequent immersions in young, female blood. Merging low art and high production values, this is one of the dullest, least sexy lesbian vampire movies ever made. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)    *'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out, with Steve Carell, in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)    'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Stephen Holden)    'THE GREAT RAID' (R, 132 minutes) This tedious World War II movie, which re-enacts a real-life heroic rescue of American prisoners from a Japanese camp in the Philippines, slogs across the screen like a forced march in quicksand. (Holden)    *'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)    * 'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of the man's pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    *'MARGARET CHO: THE ASSASSIN TOUR' (No rating, 85 minutes) A live taping of Ms. Cho's standup performance on May 14, 2005, at the Warner Theater in Washington. Equal parts inspired clown, committed activist and ferocious Republican-baiter, Ms. Cho seeks out the bruises on American culture and gleefully applies pressure. (Catsoulis)    *'THE MEMORY OF A KILLER' (R, 120 minutes, in Flemish and French) Directed by Erik Van Looy, this nicely kinked Belgian thriller features a range of good guys and bad, including one whose sense of morality and world-weariness seem straight out of a Jean-Pierre Melville film. (Dargis)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    *'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of this exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)    'MUST LOVE DOGS' (PG-13, 92 minutes) This tepid sitcom about computer dating wastes the talents of its stars (Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing) in stale, dated material that makes Nora Ephron's trifles look like Chekhov. (Holden)    * 'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)    'THE SKELETON KEY' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Kate Hudson in a T-shirt and underwear, intimations of unspeakable evil, slamming doors and equally slamming edits, and an introductory course in hoodoo, a folk religion born in the South -- all this and Gena Rowlands, Peter Sarsgaard and John Hurt, too. (Dargis)    * 'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question ''Is there life after high school?'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)    'A SOUND OF THUNDER' (PG-13, 103 minutes) A bloated, incoherent adaptation of a spare, elegant Ray Bradbury story. ''This can't be good,'' one character remarks. No, indeed. (Scott)    'STEAL ME' (No rating, 95 minutes) When a 15-year-old kleptomaniac lands in rural Montana searching for his prostitute mother, his arrival sends waves of sexual excitement through every female within pheromone-sniffing distance. Overheated material redeemed by natural performances and a screenplay that probes the bond between mothers and sons with unusual fearlessness. (Catsoulis)    *'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) In this delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, a lonely man awakens to life for the first time at 37 during a brief idyll. Directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)    'TRANSPORTER 2' (PG-13, 88 minutes) Ex-Special Forces operative Frank Martin (Jason Statham), the blank-faced professional driver with more tricks -- and lives -- than James Bond, is back in this purely shallow, but never dull, sequel to ''The Transporter.'' This time, he's in Miami and will do whatever it takes to save the life of a young boy who's been kidnapped and injected with a deadly contagious virus. (Kern)    * '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)    'USHER' (No rating, playing with three shorts with a total running time of 95 minutes) A 40-minute version of Edgar Allan Poe's ''Fall of the House of Usher,'' which favors literateness over melodrama and psychological kinks over special effects. Directed by Curtis Harrington with old-fashioned stateliness, ''Usher'' may be stilted but it is also quite touching. Accompanied by three of the director's early shorts. (Catsoulis)    'VALIANT' (G, 80 minutes) Homing pigeons versus falcons are the combatants in this shoddily made animated movie about heroes and villains in World War II. The talents of many fine British actors are squandered in the voice-overs. (Holden)    'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)    Film Series    9/11/03: A DAY IN THE LIFE OF NEW YORK (Sunday) The Two Boots Pioneer Theater concludes its run of Richard Karz's documentary about the second anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks.

(Laura Sinagra)    AESOP ROCK, BLACKALICIOUS, LADY SOVEREIGN, APSCI (Thursday) The self-deprecating rapper Aesop Rock and the conscious hip-hoppers Blackalicious are charming if not explosive. Few M.C.'s ride the jerky rhythms of grime, a British mix of hip-hop and techno, quite like the adorably brash 17-year-old Lady Sovereign. The Brooklyn-based husband-and-wife duo Apsci serve up beats that slide from synth-electro to glitch electronica. 6:30 p.m., Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212)353-1600, $20. (Sinagra)    AMADOU AND MARIAM, LAURA VIERS (Thursday) Amadou and Mariam, a duo who met in a school for the blind in Mali, build their pop from relatively traditional materials; their songs start out sweetly and spiral upward with increasing passion. Lately they've worked with the eclectic world-music producer Manu Chao. The ethereal but edgy singer-songwriter Laura Viers opens at this CMJ event. 8:30 p.m., Hiro Ballroom, 363 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212)727-0212, $25. (Jon Pareles)    MARC ANTHONY, ALEJANDRO FERNÁNDEZ (Tonight) Mr. Anthony is the biggest-selling salsa artist of all time; he is still passionately riding the rhythm as well as reportedly coaching his new wife, Jennifer Lopez, on the finer points of full-bodied singing. Mr. Fernández, the Mexican crooner, sings sweeping love ballads as well as mariachi standards. 7, Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741, $49.50 to $129. 50. (Sinagra)    DEVENDRA BANHART (Wednesday) Devendra Banhart's eerie, wavery voice and stream-of-consciousness songs reach back to the childlike surrealism of some of psychedelia's most beloved oddballs: Syd Barrett and the preglam rock of Marc Bolan. This CMJ bill also includes the rapper Beans, the British garage partiers the Cribs and the yelping bashers King of France. 7 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15 (sold out). (Sinagra)    BLOC PARTY, THE KILLS, NOISETTES (Tonight) Many bands steal sounds from the danceable punk of the early 80's, but few do it with the enthusiasm of Britain's Bloc Party. It is joined by the lanky rock duo the Kills and the Noisettes, who play shouty funk-pop with vocals recalling the X-Ray Spex. 6:45, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $25. (Sinagra)    GREG BROWN (Tomorrow) Greg Brown has quietly become one of the luminaries of the folky circuit. In his songs, cautious optimism slow-dances with resolute melancholy. He anatomizes despair with the droll familiarity of someone who expects to be stuck there for a while. His voice is a low growl shading toward a whisper; his tunes, set to his fingerpicked acoustic guitar, have the homey simplicity of hymns, waltzes or the blues. 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $25. (Pareles)    CIRCLE JERKS (Tonight and tomorrow night) Led by the outspoken frontman Keith Morris, this seminal West Coast punk band fuses gross-outs with a blunt, anti-establishment critique. 7, CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052, $40. (Sinagra)    DOVES (Wednesday) Doves bring a rough ''Madchester'' dance pedigree to their sweeping guitar pop, making this trio's music slightly edgier than that of other British acts, like Coldplay. Also on this CMJ bill are Marjorie Fair and Unbusted. 7 p.m., Warsaw at the Polish National Home, 261 Driggs Avenue, at Eckford Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (212)645-5156, $30. (Sinagra)    DUNGEN (Thursday) This Swedish band's biker-rock combines humongous riffing with whimsical jams, conjuring both black-leather aggression and the pastoral wonder of the open road. Also on this CMJ bill are the glam-metal Diamond Nights and the metal folkies Tarantula A.D. 9:30 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15.(Sinagra)    FEIST (Tuesday and Wednesday) The Canadian bohemian Feist is good at affecting a Continental, beer-hall gloom, but her best cabaret-pop songs are quirky jazz numbers; she sounds like a hipper Norah Jones. Tuesday at 8:30 p.m., with the Canadian folk-pop band Great Lake Swimmers, which records its hushed music in abandoned silos and rural churches, $20. Wednesday she headlines a seven-band CMJ slate starting at 7 p.m. at the Knitting Factory Main Space, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212)219-3006, $20. (Sinagra)    DIAMANDA GALAS (Tonight) There are no small emotions for Ms. Galas, whose compositions are music theater with its rawest nerves exposed. She takes up fear and rage, mourning and vengeance; her voice can reach operatic heights or slice through a room with primal moans and shrieks and sobs. This is the East Coast debut of ''Defixiones, Orders From the Dead,'' a ''sacred operatic mass.'' 8, Schimmel Center for the Arts, Pace University, 3 Spruce Street, between Park Row and Gold Street, Lower Manhattan, (212)279-4200, $15 to $35. (Pareles)    GREAT JEWISH ARTISTS PERFORM GREAT JEWISH COMPOSERS (Tuesday) The program of this year's Jewish Music Heritage Festival's opening night seems to have been conceived by the wicked minds who pair up the presenters for MTV awards shows. It features the Klezmatics performing songs by Randy Newman; the experimental jazz guitarist Marc Ribot assaying Billy Joel; the jazzy klezmer group Pharoah's Daughter doing Carly Simon; and the Russian-born singer and pianist (and Strokes collaborator) Regina Spektor taking on both the work of Leonard Cohen and that of the Kabbalah evangelist ''Esther,'' better known as Madonna. Uri Caine and Tovah Feldshuh pay homage to Copland and the Gershwins. The hasidic reggae musician Matisyahu performs the folk songs of Shlomo Carlebach. 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212)415-5500; V.I.P. seating, $125, general, $48. (Sinagra)    HEAD OF FEMUR (Thursday) With distorted and stuttered guitar and falsetto vocals, Head of Femur blurts its impressions and confessions, urged on by horns that seem to have strayed from the football field to the hangout under the bleachers. This CMJ bill includes the Scotland Yard Gospel Choir and Le Concorde, who play later slots. 10:45 p.m., Arlene's Grocery, 95 Stanton Street, one block below Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212)358-1633, $7.

(Sinagra)    SEU JORGE (Sunday and Monday) The Brazilian singer Seu Jorge may be best known here for his lilting samba covers of David Bowie songs in Wes Anderson's movie ''The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.'' His music avoids the traditional Brazilian styles, favoring crowd-pleasing funk-pop and loverman R&B. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $22 in advance, $25 at the door. (Sinagra)    KANINE RECORDS NIGHT (Wednesday) The Brooklyn label Kanine offers a CMJ lineup of top-notch quirky bands like the noise-folk wackos Grizzly Bear, the shaggy art-rockers Oxford Collapse, the electro-poppers Mixel Pixel, the electro-punks Mommy and Daddy and the pop-punkers Four Voltz. 7:30 p.m., Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212)420-1466, $10 in advance and $12 at the door. (Sinagra)    LITTLE BROTHER (Thursday) This soul-grounded Durham, N.C., rap group forgoes Southern crunk in favor of blending the free-form experimentation of Outkast with the kind of jazzy tracks that characterized East Coast hip-hop of the mid-90's. The bill includes the rapper J-Live and the D.J. Mark Ronson, starting at 8 p.m.; Little Brother plays at 12:15 a.m. B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212)997-4144, $18. (Sinagra)    LOOKOUT RECORDS SHOWCASE (Thursday) This great CMJ showcase features the whimsical indie rocker Mary Timony (12 a.m.), the pleasantly droney pop of the Oranges Band (11 p.m.), the hard-riffing wit of Hockey Night and the catchy screeds of Elizabeth Elmore's Reputation (8 p.m.). Troubled Hubble and the Dollyrots also play. Show starts at 7 p.m.; $12, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212)475-7088, $12. (Sinagra)    J MASCIS (Sunday) He reunited earlier this summer for a few shows with the original lineup of Dinosaur Jr., his seminal rock band that melded the apathetic cool of American punk with the guitar blare of classic rock. He plays solo here for CBGB, which has lost its lease but continues to fight to stay open. 8 p.m., CBGB, 315 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212)982-4052, $20.(Sinagra)    THE NATIONAL, CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH (Tonight) The National is a group of New York-based Ohio natives who play a kind of pent-up, countrified indie rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. The Brooklyn quintet Clap Your Hands Say Yeah recalls the shamanic whine and thrum of the mid-1990's lo-fi rocker Neutral Milk Hotel and sometimes the paranoid quirkiness of the Talking Heads. 8:30, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15 (sold out).(Sinagra)    THE NEW PORNOGRAPHERS (Thursday) This revved-up Vancouver outfit's tight power-pop grandeur builds with a sort of time-release tension, until the voice of Neko Case cuts through like a triumphant skywriter. 5 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $20. (Sinagra)    NEW YORK SALSA FESTIVAL: VICTOR MANUELLE, INDIA, TITO ROJAS, OSCAR D'LEON, SONORA PONCEÑA (Tomorrow) This 30th annual collection of salsa musicians includes Victor Manuelle, one of the most important soneros of his generation, with brassy, hard-swinging declamations of love songs and soaring improvisations traded with the band. The brash-voiced India has teamed up with musicians like Eddie Palmieri, Marc Anthony and Tito Puente. Tito Rojas has been one of the leading Puerto Rican salsa singers since the 1980's, making hits with both ballads and dance tunes. The suavely forceful Venezuelan singer Oscar D'Leon leads a high-powered dance band that holds on to the best aspects of 1970's and 80's salsa. La Sonora Ponceña has been one of the cornerstones of Puerto Rican salsa since it was founded in 1954. Its arrangements are at once transparent and propulsive, with pinpoint horns, percussion and keyboard behind ardent vocals. 7 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741, $39.50 to $ 99.50. (Pareles)    NOUVELLE VAGUE (Tomorrow, Tuesday and Wednesday) These French multi-instrumentalists have hit upon a lucrative shtick, covering jittery post-punk gems like Joy Division's dark, swirling ''Love Will Tear Us Apart'' as dispassionate bossa nova chill music. Tomorrow and Tuesday, 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212)239-6200, $18 to $20.

(Sinagra)    ROLLING STONES (Tuesday) The band's newest album is its most stripped-down in 20 years. And as the 62-year-old sexpot Mick Jagger shouts ''Sweet Neo Con'' from stadium stages at what could be President Bush's most vulnerable moment, the Stones even seem politically relevant. 8 p.m., Madison Square Garden, (212)465-6741, $64.50 to $454.50. (Sinagra)    SIGUR ROS, AMINA (Monday and Tuesday) The Icelandic atmospherists Sigur Ros continue to pursue the hope and dread of open expanse and conjure with their sung gibberish a kind of ur-poetry. Amina is an all-female string quartet that similarly muses on vastness. 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212)496-7070, $33.50 to $50. (Sinagra)    REGINA SPEKTOR, DEVOTCHKA (Thursday) Ms. Spektor's music is of the jaggedly quirky cabaret variety. It brings punk immediacy into a chamber setting, reveling in knotty rhymes and slightly unhinged melodrama. She is joined by the Gyspy punk band DeVotchKa. Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212)777-6800, $18.50 in advance, $20 at the door. (Sinagra)    WIDE RIGHT (Tomorrow) This rocking bar band features one of the more winsome singer-guitarists around in the person of the chatty, no-nonsense frontwoman Leah Archibald. Ms. Archibald, a Buffalo transplant, makes life as a musician mom look easy while writing sometimes scathing, shrewd domestic portraits and observant odes to rust-belt culture. 8 p.m., Magnetic Field, 97 Atlantic Avenue, at Henry Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718)834-0069, $4. (Sinagra)    THE WRENS, SPARROW (Thursday) The smart noise-rockers the Wrens write about life in their home state, New Jersey, but not with a smirk. With understated, meditative albums and intense, up-tempo live shows, they offer two different responses to suburban tensions. Their labelmate Sparrow plays this CMJ showcase at 10 p.m., with the Wrens at 1 a.m. Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)260-4700, $15.

(Stephen Holden)    Jazz    Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    BAUHAUS QUARTET (Tuesday) Kevin Norton is a probing drummer, vibraphonist and composer, although not always in that order; his Bauhaus Quartet, which becomes a quintet here with the addition of the pianist Angelica Sanchez, exemplifies the taut intellectualism of jazz's far-left wing. 8 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10.(Nate Chinen)    DAVE BINNEY AND FRIENDS (Through Sunday) Mr. Binney, a graceful yet gutsy alto saxophonist, enlists a handful of marquee collaborators, including the guitarist Adam Rogers and the drummer Brian Blade.

Rose Hall, 60th Street and Broadway, Jazz at Lincoln Center, (212)258-9595; $80.50 and $140.50. (Chinen)    *DAVE BURRELL 65TH-BIRTHDAY CONCERT (Sunday) The pianist Dave Burrell has been a soft-spoken hero of the avant-garde for the last 40 years and still ranks among its most panoramic stylists. His first set here will spotlight his solo piano vocabulary, which extends as far back as Fats Waller; the second will feature a trio, with Michael Formanek on bass and Guillermo Brown on drums. 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, www.thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)    JAMES CARTER ORGAN TRIO (Tuesday through Sept. 18) Mr. Carter, the irrepressibly charismatic saxophonist, leads a sturdy and occasionally surprising soul-jazz unit with the Hammond B-3 organist Gerard Gibbs and the drummer Leonard King; special guests include the Lionel Loueke Trio, which opens on Tuesday and Wednesday, and the baritone saxophonist Hamiet Bluiett, who joins the ensemble on Thursday. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212)475-8592; cover, $25 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $15 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)    GERALD CLEAVER'S UNCLE JUNE (Wednesday) Dealing less in rhythm than in pulse, Mr. Cleaver's drumming perfectly suits the fluid requirements of jazz's post-everything avant-garde; this ruminative project enlists the tenor saxophonist Tony Malaby, the violinist Mat Maneri, the keyboardist Craig Taborn and the bassist Drew Gress. 10 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718)965-9177; cover, $8.

(Chinen)    BEN PEROWSKY QUARTET (Thursday) As a drummer, Mr. Perowsky is adept at a careering sort of propulsion; as a bandleader, he favors shifting layers and dry humor.

(Chinen)    JEAN-MICHEL PILC TRIO (Wednesday through Sept. 18) Mr. Pilc's piano playing has a joyous bounce, no matter how dark or furious the extemporization; he's celebrating the release of a new album, ''Live at Iridium, New York'' (Dreyfus), with the bassist Thomas Bramerie and the drummer Mark Mondesir. 8 and 10 p.m. (8:30, 10:30 and 11:45 on Sept. 16; and 8, 10 and 11:30 on Sept. 17), Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212)582-2121; cover, $25 to $27.50, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    *QUEST (Wednesday through Sept. 17) Formed in 1981 and disbanded a decade later, this acoustic quartet often shrouded its experimental ethos in gauzy introspection; now the saxophonist Dave Liebman and the pianist Richie Beirach, the group's founding core, are reuniting with the second-generation members Ron McClure (bassist) and Billy Hart (drummer) for what could be an intriguing update. 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212)581-3080; cover, $30, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)    MATANA ROBERTS QUARTET (Wednesday) A husky-toned alto saxophonist and junior member of Chicago's Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, Matana Roberts is at her best when responding to ensemble actions; she has a good sparring partner here in the cornetist Taylor Ho Bynum. 10 p.m., Zebulon, 258 Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718)218-6934; no cover. (Chinen)    JOHN SCOFIELD BAND (Through Sunday) ''That's What I Say'' (Verve), Mr. Scofield's latest album, is a spirited and sprawling tribute to the music of Ray Charles; he treads that turf here with a quintet including Meyer Statham on vocals and trombone, Gary Versace on keyboards, John Benitez on bass and Steve Hass on drums. 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212)475-8592; cover, $35 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $20 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum.

(Holland)    'PATIENCE' (Tomorrow and Thursday) The director Tazewell Thompson's wildly costumed and zany production of Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Patience'' was an audience favorite when it was introduced at the Glimmerglass Opera last year. The production has its debut at the New York City Opera tomorrow. This 1881 operetta invites the broad humor and snappy choreography that Mr. Tazewell has come up with. Gilbert and Sullivan poke fun at the aesthetics movement then championed by Oscar Wilde. A group of 20 lovesick maidens, who will only consider engagements to men of high-minded artistic sensibilities, are torn between two effete poets, Reginald Bunthorne and Archibald Grosvenor. But the rival poets find themselves smitten by the innocent milkmaid Patience, who cares nothing for their verses and believes in a truer, more romantic form of love. The musical theater actor and singer Michael Ball makes his City Opera debut as Reginald, with Kevin Burdette as Archibald and Tonna Miller as Patience. Gary Thor Wedow conducts. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., New York State Theater, (212)721-6500; $45 t0 $120. (Anthony Tommasini)    'TOSCA' (Tomorrow and Sunday) Diminutive, venerable and unbowed, the Amato Opera, a salty old-school denizen of New York, opens its 58th season this week with an even more venerable standby, Puccini's ''Tosca.'' Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, , (212)228-8200; $30; 65+, students with ID and children, $25.(Anne Midgette)    Classical Music    ARGENTO CHAMBER ENSEMBLE (Tomorrow) This adventurous new music group has titled its season-opening concert ''French Connections,'' and the program includes premieres by Philippe Hurel, Michel Galante, Jacob Druckman and Michael Klingbeil. 8:30 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $12; students and 62+, $7. (Jeremy Eichler)    BARGEMUSIC (Tonight, tomorrow, Sunday and Thursday) Great views and typically fresh performances help make this floating concert hall one of the city's more inviting settings for chamber music. Tonight, José Ramos Santana offers solo piano works by Albéniz and Héctor Campos Parsi. Tomorrow and Sunday, it's piano trios by Beethoven, Mozart and Dvorak with Steven Beck, piano; Mark Peskanov, violin; and Clancy Newman, cello. And Thursday, an entire chamber orchestra will somehow cram itself on and around the tiny barge stage for works by Mozart, Bartok, Brahms and Hossein Alizadeh. Tonight, tomorrow night and Thursday night at 7:30; Sunday at 4 p.m. Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing next to the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718)624-2083, $35; Thursday, $50; 62+, $40.

(Oestreich)    COUNTER)INDUCTION (Tonight) This inventive new-music ensemble builds its concerts around both modern classics and works just off the composer's desk. Tonight that combination includes Karel Husa's ''Sonata a Tre,'' from the classics category, and recent works by Georges Aperghis, Eric Moe, Douglas Boyce, Alexandre Lunsqui and Eli Marshal. 8, Tenri Cultural Institute, 43A West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212)645-2800, suggested donation, $12.(Allan Kozinn)    DIAMANDA GALAS (Tomorrow) Ms. Galas returns with her banshee soprano and extravagant vocal effects for an evening described as a ''sacred mass'' and titled ''Defixiones: Orders From the Dead.'' 8 p.m., Schimmel Center for the Arts, Pace University, 3 Spruce Street, between Park Row and Gold Street, Lower Manhattan, (212)279-4200, $15 to $35.(Holland)    INTERPRETATIONS (Thursday) The Interpretations series, assembled by Thomas Buckner and presented by the adventurous World Music Institute, opens for the season with a characteristically diverse program of contemporary works. In this installment, the flutist Robert Dick and the pianist Ursel Schlicht share a bill with Yasunao Tone, a mixed-media and computer composer. 8 p.m. at Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)545-7536, $10. (Kozinn)    MARI KIMURA (Tomorrow) This violinist and composer uses both a conventional (acoustic) violin and a MIDI instrument that triggers sounds from a computer. One of her projects is a series of programs called ''Rite,'' on which she has been collaborating with Yoshihiro Kanno, a composer based in Tokyo. Although both Mr. Kanno's and Ms. Kimura's works use the latest digital technology, they draw on antique sounds as well: the performers on the current program include Tamami Tono, who plays the sho, a traditional Japanese mouth organ, and Bruce Gremo, who performs on the shakuhachi, a Japanese flute. 8 p.m., Tenri Cultural Institute, 43A West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212)645-2800, $15. (Kozinn)    MEET THE COMPOSER AT THE MERCANTILE LIBRARY (Wednesday) Always on the lookout for new ways to get more attention for contemporary composers, the service organization Meet the Composer is starting a new four-concert series this fall showcasing a few highly respected composers who are highly underrepresented in the standard ''uptown'' concert scene. First up are Eve Beglarian and Corey Dargel, joined by the flutist Margaret Lancaster for a program of so-called ''electro-cabaret'' and art songs. 6:30 p.m., Mercantile Library, Second Floor Reading Room, 17 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212)755-6710, $15.(Midgette)    MOSTLY MODERN (Tonight, Monday and Thursday) Offering professional music with the intimacy of a house concert, the tiny hall-let of the Austrian Cultural Forum is the setting for this year's ''Mostly Modern'' festival, which opens with a soprano, Anna Maria Pammer, and a pianist, Clemens Zeilinger, marking the 60th anniversary of Webern's death with an all-Webern program, and continuing with the chamber ensemble Die Reihe juxtaposing Vienna and New York with works by Cage and Feldman, Wellesz and Webern, and others. Friday and Monday nights at 8 (Pammer/Zeilinger); Thursday night at 8 (Die Reihe, continuing through next weekend), Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212)319-5300, free; reservations strongly recommended.

Musicians donate their services for an annual concert that commemorates the victims and raises money for peace-related causes. This year, the program features an eclectic roster of classical and world musicians, including the Shanghai Quartet and members of the Guarneri Quartet; a string orchestra called the Knights; the Iranian musician Siamak Jahangiri performing a work by Hossein Alizadeh; and the bouzouki player Avram Pengas joining the ensemble Musique Sans Frontières. 7:30 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212)501-3330, $25 to $125.

The festival opens with three programs featuring 35 groups and individuals (tonight and tomorrow afternoon and evening) at Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea. Then it's up to Marcus Garvey Park, 122nd Street and Mount Morris Park West, for a free outdoor program called ''Dance Harlem'' (Sunday) and another event at the Synod House of the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, 112th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, Morningside Heights (Tuesday). The festival's first week ends back downtown again at Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village (Thursday). Tonight and Tuesday night at 7:30; tomorrow at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Thursday at 9:30 p.m.; $10 (tomorrow afternoon); $15 (tonight, tomorrow and Tuesday and Thursday nights); (212)924-0077 or www.dancenownyc.org.

Tonight (and Thursday and Friday nights through Oct. 7) at 8; tomorrow (and Saturdays through Oct. 8) at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays (through Oct. 9) at 4 p.m. Thalia Spanish Theater, 41-17 Greenpoint Avenue, Sunnyside, Queens, (718)729-3880; Thursdays and Fridays, $25; Saturdays and Sundays, $30; students and 65+, $27.

Museums    *BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE CENTER FOR AMERICAN ART VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Roberta Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400.(Grace Glueck)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Holland Cotter)    *MET: 'MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES,' through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of his life and work. (See above.) (Smith)    EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO: 'THE (S) FILES/THE SELECTED FILES 05,' through Jan. 29. The definition of what ''Latino art'' means is changing in a post-identity-politics time, and this modest biennial, drawn mostly from unsolicited proposals submitted by artists in the greater New York area, is an indicator of what that change looks like. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, (212)831-7272. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Ken Johnson)    BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'AIM 25/ARTIST IN THE MARKETPLACE,' through Oct. 30. This show is the culminating event of an annual 12-week museum residency that focuses on the mechanics of career development. The work is as diverse as the backgrounds of the more than 30 artists, who all live in New York, though many were born elsewhere, including Brazil, Croatia, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Libya, Mexico and the Philippines. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718)681-6000. (Cotter)    MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK CHANGING: DOUGLAS LEVERE REVISITS BERENICE ABBOTT'S NEW YORK,' through Nov. 13 . During the 1930's, the Modernist photographer Berenice Abbott photographed the architectural fabric of New York City with a keen eye for contrasts of new and old. Between 1997 and 2003, Douglas Levere returned to the scenes that she photographed and photographed them again. Seeing 50 of his paired with her originals is a fascinating education in how things change. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212)534-1672. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Johnson)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HÉLION, through Oct. 9. Hélion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans before and after World War II. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or weaknesses, but is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)    *NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN,' through Sept. 26. ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Michael Kimmelman)    QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Nov. 6. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)    UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART, 'LANDSCAPE,' through Sept. 18. With only 20 works dispersed throughout the Whitney's second floor, this startlingly fresh installation of recent art from its collection uses space in an extravagant, exhilarating way, while weaving a cat's cradle of intersecting meanings, emotions, forms and processes through the landscapes of American art and history. It turns out that the less you look at, the more you can see, especially in an arrangement orchestrated by someone who believes that the best tool for coaxing out an artwork's polymorphous content is another piece of art. This someone is Donna De Salvo, the museum's new associate director for programs and curator of collections; her Whitney debut should be seen by anyone interested in the craft and art of curating. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Smith)    WHITNEY MUSEUM: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. (See above.) (Glueck)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM : BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART AT ALTRIA: 'PAST PRESENCE: CHILDHOOD AND MEMORY,' through Oct. 13. This modestly resonant show of works relating to juvenile experience presents a glass cabinet filled with 2,000 miniature white ceramic vessels by Charles LeDray; small, finely drawn, photo-based pictures of children by Peggy Preheim; drawings copied from hunting manuals by Robert Beck; and a politically suggestive chalkboard drawing by Gary Simmons. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917)663-2453. (Johnson)    Galleries: Uptown    'BEYOND GEOGRAPHY: FORTY YEARS OF VISUAL ARTS AT THE AMERICAS SOCIETY' Anyone who wants to view art from a hemispheric perspective should see this review of four decades of adventurous art exhibiting by an organization founded to promote understanding among the nations of North, South and Central America. Works here range from a beautiful, all-gold Inca mask to a sound installation by the Canadian avant-garde filmmaker Michael Snow. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)249-8950, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook in which he recorded his visual impressions, this show of about 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of sailboats, spired churches and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. The show gives a partial but lively account of his journeys, geographical and aesthetic. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through Sept. 16. (Glueck)    Galleries: 57th Street    'BIRTH OF A CULTURE: 60'S AND 70'S SURF PHOTOGRAPHY BY LEROY GRANNIS' Big, new color prints of surfing action shot during the sport's golden age by a photographer who earned major awards for his work for surfing magazines and initiation into the International Surfing Hall of Fame. Bonni Benrubi, 41 East 57th Street, (212)888-6007, through Oct. 1. (Johnson)    'INTRODUCTIONS' Three solo minishows: oblique, conceptually evocative photographs by Tim Davis; lurid and juicy paintings of ornate theater interiors by Emi Avora; and diverse drawings and photographs, some funny, some poetic, by Barry Ratoff. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)    *'REPEAT PERFORMANCE'  More than 20 artists use repetition as their main formal device and many different kinds of materials. The show includes concentric circles drawn by Eva Hesse; black pinstripes painted by Frank Stella; solid glass orbs with opalescent surfaces attached to the wall by Tom Bell; colored wax copies of plastic tumblers by George Stoll; and botanically accurate leaves made entirely of staples by Alison Foshee. Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212)755-0434, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    *JUSTIN LOWE This gallery's back room is basically just an extension of a store, but to round out a long, hot city summer, Mr. Lowe has turned it into a combination gallery, library and listening room. Printed Matter gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)925-0325, through Sept. 24. (Cotter)    'ON VIEW: PHOTOGRAPHING THE MUSEUM' Among 20 well-selected ways of picturing the museum are Elliot Erwitt's view of a naked sculptural Diana aiming her arrow at an unsuspecting live male visitor; wax figures by Hiroshi Sugimoto and Diane Arbus; a specimen drawer full of cardinals (birds, that is) by Terry Evans; and the dreamlike image of three real foxes in a formal period room by Karen Knorr. Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    *BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20-inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Sept. 24. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ARTISTS AND PATRONS IN TRADITIONAL AFRICAN CULTURES: AFRICAN SCULPTURE FROM THE GARY SCHULZE COLLECTION'  Queensborough Community College has quietly assembled an impressive collection of African art. A year ago, the college inaugurated a permanent display of the collection in its campus gallery. And this summer the gallery is presenting a temporary exhibition of nearly 100 sculptures from a private collection. Queensborough Community College Art Gallery, the City University of New York, 222-05 56th Avenue, Bayside, Queens, (718)631-6396, through Sept. 30. (Cotter)    'EXILE, NEW YORK IS A GOOD HOTEL' This new gallery, established by the German-based critic and curator Anke Kempkes, offers a spectacular view of the Empire State Building and a show of work by young artists from Berlin, Glasgow and Warsaw, along with a collaborative slide piece by the New Yorkers Ken Okiishi and Nick Mauss. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, near 28th Street, Apt. 1602, (212)481-0362, through Sept. 16, by appointment. (Cotter)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. The Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    Last Chance    'ALONG THE WAY: M.T.A. ARTS FOR TRANSIT' This extensive survey of artworks commissioned over the last two decades by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is more that just a promotional event. Including paintings, drawings, photographs and sculptures by dozens of well-known artists, it is a fascinating window onto an artscape usually only glimpsed by commuters in bits and pieces. UBS, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, at 51st Street, (212)713-2885, closing today.(Johnson)    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT' From Grandma Moses' depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040, closing on Sunday. (Glueck)    'ANOTHER EXPO: BEYOND THE NATION STATE' An international group of eight politically minded Conceptualists takes on nationalism. The most striking work is Marina Abramovic's large staged photograph of herself sitting in a mournful posture on a pile of bloody bones. White Box, 525 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212)714-2347, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall aqua box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, closing tomorrow, by appointment. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION'  A selection of fair to good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535, closing on Sunday. (Johnson)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO' The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures, closing on Monday. (See above.) (Cotter)    * NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHANGRI-LA' This film by Patty Chang, best known for her performance work, was made in China near the Tibet border. Loosely based on the 1930's novel ''Lost Horizons,'' Ms. Chang's film amplifies and shatters whatever the utopian realness of Shangri-La is, and does so with wit and visual panache. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)    'A.B. NORMAL'  Seven artists, including John Bock, Tim Hawkinson and Rirkrit Tiravanija, mostly deal in eccentric machinery. Best is a life-size hyperrealistic Zamboni made of rigid pale-green insulation foam by Chris Hanson & Hendrika Sonnenberg. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)473-4447, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    'PRECIOUS MOMENTS' Mall culture, with its peculiar poignancies, is the theme of ''Precious Moments,'' a smart, sad five-person show organized by the artist Josh Kline. Joymore, 236 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (646)270-0376, closing tomorrow. (Cotter)    IRIS VAN DONGEN: 'AURELIA' Most prominent among works playing with various styles are large, possibly ironic drawings of beautiful young women that look as if they were made for the covers of modern romance novels. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, closing on Thursday.

"The discovery of ''pretzel syndrome'' was certainly expedited by the availability of the whole human genome sequence, but that does not make it ''genomic'' per se. In contrast to genetic medicine, true genomic medicine will require a new breed of physician, trained to address the more genetically complex diseases that are alluded to in the article -- Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, heart disease, hypertension, stroke and cancer -- with tools that are capable of whole genome interrogation. These conditions generally result from multiple genes (perhaps hundreds or even thousands) interacting with the environment to cause disease. True genomic medicine seeks to understand both the underlying causal genes and environmental factors in order to provide more precise predictions of health outcomes, as well as more tailored and effective therapies.
