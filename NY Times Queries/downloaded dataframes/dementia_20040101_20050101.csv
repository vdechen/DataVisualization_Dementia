"SILBERSTEIN--William, a devoted family man and a passionate and accomplished athlete, who after an extraordinary career as an entrepreneur, generously devoted his life to philanthropy, died Wednesday night at New York University Medical Center. He was 88. Born in Brooklyn, NY, in 1916, Silberstein was a 'Hoosier' at heart. He attended Indiana University on a basketball and tennis scholarship and was a key member of the university's 1935 ''Big 10'' Basketball championship team. It was there he met his wife of 61 years, Sylvia Levin. They married October 12, 1937, in Crown Point, Ind. Shortly after college Mr. Silberstein started a chain of jewelry stores. He also ventured into the real estate business. It was after the Silbersteins moved to Scarsdale in 1950 that Mr. Silberstein with the dedicated help of his wife founded Sealectro Corp., a lucrative electronic components company, which went public in the 1970s and was later sold to BICC in 1981. Today the company is currently known as ITT Sealectro. The Silbersteins relocated to Rye in 1968, where Mr. Silberstein has resided since. Mrs. Silberstein passed away in 1998. In 1985 Mr. Silberstein established William Silberstein Associates, Inc. in Mamaroneck, New York. The organization provides operational assistance to manufacturing concerns, acquisitional evaluation of companies and organizes capital ventures. The Silbersteins shared a deep philosophy for giving back to the community. The couple owns the distinction as donors of the first fully endowed athletic scholarship in the history of Indiana University.

Above all of his successful enterprises and life accomplishments, William Silberstein always placed his family and friends first. He gave and received bounteous love, joy, and wholeness through his children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. William Silberstein is survived by a daughter, Betsy Levinson; a son, Bruce, and his wife, Carolyn; a son, Sigmund; his five grandchildren, Beth Grotta, Jill Altneu, Debbie Deitz, Michael Silberstein and Matthew Silberstein; and three great - grandchildren, Mat thew and Lindsey Grotta, and Brooke Altneu. ''I had a life replete with excitement and challenges. My success can be attributed to luck, hard work, and timing. I love being around people and have been fortunate in having in my life, my family and many good friends,'' said Silberstein, reflecting on his life in a 2000 interview.

He was 88. Born in Brooklyn, NY, in 1916, Silberstein was a 'Hoosier' at heart. He attended Indiana University on a basketball and tennis scholarship and was a key member of the university's 1935 ""Big 10"" Basketball championship team. It was there he met his wife of 61 years, Sylvia Levin. They married October 12, 1937, in Crown Point, Ind. Shortly after college Mr. Silberstein started a chain of jewelry stores. He also ventured into the real estate business. It was after the Silbersteins moved to Scarsdale in 1950 that Mr. Silberstein with the dedicated help of his wife founded Sealectro Corp., a lucrative electronic components company, which went public in the 1970s and was later sold to BICC in 1981. Today the company is currently known as ITT Sealectro. The Silbersteins relocated to Rye in 1968, where Mr. Silberstein has resided since. Mrs. Silberstein passed away in 1998. In 1985 Mr. Silberstein established William Silberstein Associates, Inc. in Mamaroneck, New York. The organization provides operational assistance to manufacturing concerns, acquisitional evaluation of companies and organizes capital ventures.

But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed Off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $95.  BEN BRANTLEY    * 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988, directed by Mark Brokaw. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end, you may feel like you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51-$79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure on stage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naïf of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Hirschfeld, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    + 'DIRTY TRICKS' Distinguishing between blazing energy and plain old desperation isn't always easy. Look at Martha Mitchell, who as the wife of United States Attorney General John Mitchell teetered so spectacularly between high spirits and dementia during the Watergate era. Now in John Jeter's ''Dirty Tricks,'' the redoubtable Judith Ivey has taken on the woman whose eagerness to share secrets and fears with the American people helped bring down the presidency of Richard Nixon. Ms. Ivey, as always, has vitality and skill to spare. But these assets are deployed in a vain attempt to paper over the seams in a conspicuously piecemeal play. Like its compulsively chatty heroine, ''Dirty Tricks'' is scattershot, hazy and, yes, desperate. Even with Ms. Ivey pouring on the cotillion-belle flirtiness and Southern discomfort, ''Dirty Tricks'' is nowhere near as entertaining or alarming as Mrs. Mitchell was at the height of her notoriety (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    * 'MRS. FARNSWORTH' Political candidates poised to sling mud might take a pointer from A. R. Gurney: good manners can be lethal weapons. Though it deals with revelations that are the stuff of smear campaigns, ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' is as polite and sweetly subversive a political attack as you're likely to come across. Set in a creative-writing classroom (with the excellent Danny Burstein as the teacher), the play unfolds around its title character's desire to write a novel about her youthful involvement with a man who sounds awfully like George W. Bush. Sigourney Weaver, returning to the role she created last spring, deploys annihilating charm as a wealthy high-WASP wife; Gerry Bamman, as her husband, completes the cast. ''Mrs. Farnsworth,'' directed by Jim Simpson, is a polemical exercise that never screams at you. Instead, it feels as if it is spoken out of the side of the mouth -- sotto voce and through a locked jaw. As delivered by Ms. Weaver, this turns out be a thoroughly disarming technique (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $60.  BRANTLEY    + 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title, propelled with blizzard force in a dramatic finale (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90.  LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    + 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudités. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. (''She may not want a Scotch, Brandon. It's not dark yet, and she's only half-WASP.'') But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses and the inimitable Julie Halston, who finds the wildly surreal in the conventional role of a blue-blooded snob (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.  BRANTLEY    Last Chance    *++  ''BRIAN DYKSTRA: CORNERED & ALONE.'' You won't find many Republicans at Mr. Dykstra's intoxicating one-man comic rant of a show, not when he describes George W. Bush as ''my A.D.D.-suffering, dyslexic, drunk-driving Bush Klan president with a 13-minute attention span, leaky brain pan'' -- we pause here to omit a deprecating anatomical reference -- and the ''I.Q. of a cracked blue soap dish.'' Too bad about the production's useless, less political first half-hour, but the audience is seated cabaret-style and drinks are served (1:30). Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 352-3101. Tonight at 7. Tickets: $25.  ANITA GATES    *+ 'I AM MY OWN WIFE' (Tony winner for best play and best actor in a play). Doug Wright's one-actor play, with a thrillingly accomplished performance by Jefferson Mays and a diamond-sharp production directed by Moisés Kaufman, tells a terrific story based on a real person, Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (né Lothar Berfelde), a soft-spoken but tenaciously gender-bending biological man who died in 2002 at 74. Her lifelong obsession -- Mahlsdorf preferred to be thought of as female -- was the preservation of furniture, especially from the 1890's, and other household relics like Victrolas and gramophones. Her devotion to her astonishing collection, with which she turned her home into a museum, gave focus and motivation to a life whose grandest achievement was that it proceeded to its natural end. The play is largely about Charlotte's enduring the cruel repressions of the Nazis and the Communists, and her harrowing tales of survival through the eras of the Gestapo and the Stasi are nothing short of breathtaking. Ah, but are they credible? That also becomes an issue in the play, which very subtly but, in the end, quite powerfully makes a case for the necessity of storytelling in our lives (2:15). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $86.25, with $20 student and teacher tickets at the box office the day of show.  BRUCE WEBER    'SPATTER PATTERN (OR HOW I GOT THAT STORY)' Neal Bell's moody new play is a cautionary tale that proves the wisdom of avoiding one's neighbors. Edward Dunn (Peter Frechette), one of the dual protagonists, is a screenwriter still in shellshock over the death of his companion of more than two decades. Trying to jumpstart his stalled career, he moves into a pokey new studio apartment. His neighbor who turns out to be -- egad! -- a tabloid star, the Prof Who Offed the Co-ed, although the guilt of Marcus Tate (Darren Pettie) has yet to be proved. (He hasn't even been charged.) Edward, at emotional loose ends, strikes up a casual friendship with the celebrity next door. They are soon embroiled in a knotty psychological intimacy. Elements of Mr. Bell's murder-mystery plot suggest the playwright has logged more than a few ''Law & Order'' marathons in his television-watching diary. But the writing has a literate, high-toned shimmer that would probably bring out the red pencils from Dick Wolf's producers. Unfortunately the playwright is unable to meld these elements into a satisfying whole (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $38 to $45.  ISHERWOOD    + 'STRING OF PEARLS' It's that old one-object-through-the-years gimmick, but Michele Lowe's one-act drama makes it fresh, funny and poignant. The stellar four-woman cast includes Ellen McLaughlin, the Tony Award-winning angel from ''Angels in America,'' and Mary Testa, the Tony-nominated alcoholic voice teacher from ''On the Town.'' Along with Antoinette LaVecchia and Sharon Washington, they create more than two dozen characters in a highly satisfying, often hilarious blend of sex, satire and absurdism, with an emphasis on women's relationships and the inevitability of both loss and happiness. The play, directed with knowing sparkle by Eric Simonson, is the tale of a necklace bought by a New York man for his wife just before he dies, its loss and its travels over the next three decades. That involves a lot of women, including a divorced landlady who is kind to a woman with cancer, a Tunisian hotel housekeeper with a greedy husband, a Riverside Drive swimmer who pretends not to be rich and a 300-pound lesbian gravedigger. Even the minor characters are memorable (1:30). Primary Stages at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.  GATES    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    Now Playing    'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her long-time director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair -- from rapture to heartbreak to revenge -- the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core, and Mr. Evans has all the sexual magnetism of a boiled potato. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Bening gallantly, and she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will.  A. O. SCOTT    'CELSIUS 41.11: THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH THE BRAIN BEGINS TO DIE' Directed by Kevin Knoblock; written and produced by Lionel Chetwynd and Ted Steinberg (R, 71 minutes). If you don't know where the new film ''Celsius 41.11'' was coming from you certainly get the picture when the filmmakers cut from an image juxtaposing Michael Moore with Hitler straight to an image of John Kerry and John Edwards. If the juxtaposition weren't so shameless, if the political climate weren't so scurrilous, if the country were not actively at war and men, women and children were not dying in that war, this composite triumvirate of Moore-Hitler-Kerry might be easy to laugh off. As it is, it's a depressing indicator of our political discourse and what passes as nonfiction film these days. ''Celsius 41.11'' was made, according to a press release issued by Citizens United, the group that produced the film, ''to refute the propaganda in Michael Moore's 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' '' On a basic level, this new feature is simply another addition to the mini-industry of detractors that has sprung up around Mr. Moore and taken on a more feverish pitch since his most recent screen success. But filmmakers behind ''Celsius 41.11'' spend surprisingly little time actually going after Mr. Moore. What Mr. Knoblock, Mr. Chetwynd and Mr. Steinberg want to do with their movie is make you afraid -- very, very afraid.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' Starring Billy Bob Thornton. Directed by Peter Berg (PG-13, 105 minutes). Mr. Berg directs this Texas high school football extravaganza in a tough, gritty style that gives it an unusually fine and vivid sense of place. The place in question is Odessa, a West Texas town where football is more than just an obsession; it's the foundation of the social order and the source of life's meaning. The film, based on H. G. Bissinger's 1990 book of reportage, follows a handful of senior athletes and their put-upon coach (Mr. Thornton) through an anxious season. The town wants a state championship, and in trying to satisfy this expectation the young men face extraordinary risks and sacrifices. Conventional as it is, ''Friday Night Lights'' is both rousing and honest, and it features good performances from Derek Luke, as the team's star runner, and Lucas Black as its anxious quarterback.  SCOTT    'THE GRUDGE' Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr. Directed by Takashi Shimuzu (PG-13, 110 minutes). The haunted house in ''The Grudge'' isn't draped with cobwebs, but every so often, it issues an unsettling creak that sounds like the shifting of delicate old bones. Located in Tokyo up a long driveway where dead leaves skitter like mice, the house has been home to so many victims that its taken five movies to chronicle their unfortunate demise. All the films in the series were directed by Mr. Shimizu, who also wrote all but this one; the first four, rather bewilderingly, carry some variation on the Japanese title ''Ju-On,'' which has to do with the notion of vengeance. The film nominally pivots on Ms. Gellar, from television's ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' as Karen, an American social-work student living in Tokyo. Along with her boyfriend, Doug (Mr. Behr), an American architecture student who reads books titled, yes, ''Japanese Architecture,'' Karen is making a go in a strange new land that only gets stranger when she visits that creaky house on the hill. After another health-care worker goes missing, Karen has to walk up that hill to care for a catatonic older woman, Emma (the spooky Grace Zabriskie), who seems to have been left home alone. Creak goes the house as something that sounds like a cat goes meo-o-o-ow.  DARGIS    * 'I   HUCKABEES' Starring Dustin Hoffman, Isabelle Huppert, Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman and Lily Tomlin. Directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). This high-wire comedy captures liberal-left despair with astonishingly good humor: it's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for the screwball set. Choc-a-block with strange bedfellows -- Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Tomlin play a hot-and-heavy married couple, Mr. Schwartzman gets his groove on with Ms. Huppert -- the film is a snort-out-loud-funny master class of controlled chaos. In this topsy-turvy world, where yes is the new corporate no and businesses sponsor environmental causes while bulldozing over Ranger Rick, a pair of existential detectives sift through a client's trash to solve the riddle of his malaise. Like Mr. Russell, they gladly risk foolishness to plunge into the muck of human existence. The film is loud, messy, aggressively in your face and generally played for the back row in the theater, and it doesn't offer up solutions, tender any comfort or rejoice in the triumph of the human spirit. All we can do, says Mr. Russell, is keep pushing the rock back uphill. That's kind of a bummer, but in its passion, energy and go-for-broke daring, in its faith in the possibility of human connection (if not its probability), ''I   Huckabees'' provides its own reason for hope.  DARGIS    'LADDER 49' Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta. Directed by Jay Russell (PG-13, 115 minutes). In ''Ladder 49'' fires smolder and rage and generally act in a far more lively and persuasive fashion than any of the men struggling to put them out. A sob story, the film stars Mr. Phoenix as Jack Morrison, a once and future hero who battles untold infernos, saves untold lives and quaffs untold draft beers to become a fireman's fireman, the kind who fearlessly enters burning buildings and puts everything at risk, including a picture-perfect family and a self so radically unexamined, so thin and vaporous, it's a wonder it doesn't drift off the screen along with all the billows of enveloping smoke. Pegged as a true-to-life story, one meant to put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye, this is essentially a male weepy about strong, simple men and the strong, simple women behind them, and as such it's platitudinous rubbish. What makes this nonsense more galling than usual is that while ''Ladder 49'' might have started out as a heartfelt attempt to honor those in the line of literal fire, it weighs in as an attempt to exploit their post-Sept. 11 symbolism.  DARGIS    * 'LIGHTNING IN A BOTTLE' Directed by Antoine Fuqua (PG-13, 104 minutes). The essential ingredients for playing and singing the blues are ''juice and pain,'' says Bonnie Raitt near the end of this remarkable concert documentary. By juice, Ms. Raitt means the raw life force that surges through the music of the blues legends who gathered at Radio City Music Hall on Feb. 26, 2003 for an historic and joyous musical summit. The film weaves performances from that concert with snippets of the musicians rehearsing and swapping stories backstage, and old film clips of legends like Lead Belly, Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. The 30 performers in the concert (not counting a distinguished house band) include Ms. Raitt, Robert Cray, Solomon Burke and B. B. King. The film is moderately informative, the music intermittently thrilling.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael García Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon.  SCOTT    'SHALL WE DANCE?' Starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 106 minutes). This Americanization of a popular 1996 Japanese film is an old-fashioned feel-good fantasy that piles on the euphoria. The movie returns Mr. Gere to the site of his hoofing triumph in ''Chicago.'' His character is a mild-mannered estate lawyer, happily married with two teenage children, who on an impulse starts taking evening ballroom dancing classes. As he evolves from bland suburban frog into suave dance-floor prince, he regains his faltering zest for life and refreshes his marriage (to Ms. Sarandon). Ms. Lopez, in full sizzle, is the dedicated instructor who teaches him that ballroom dancing, as she puts it, is ''a vertical expression of a horizontal wish.''  HOLDEN    'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renée Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Where Pixar goes for sublimity and sincerity, DreamWorks continues to prefer a jokey, referential style, full of bright colors, almost-offensive ethnic stereotypes, big-name movie stars and easy cultural references that sail over the heads of the children in the audience and splatter in their parents' faces. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale.  SCOTT    * 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. Directed by Mr. Payne, who adapted the screenplay with his long-time writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book by Rex Pickett, ''Sideways'' is about a man on the verge of saying uncle to life. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Tomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack its an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future.  DARGIS    'STAGE BEAUTY' Starring Billy Crudup and Claire Danes. Directed by Richard Eyre (R, 105 minutes). A 17th-century ''Star Is Born,'' though with interestingly convoluted sexual politics and a provocative historical thesis. Mr. Crudup is Ned Kynaston, one of the biggest stars of the London stage, who specializes in playing Shakespearean heroines. Ms. Danes is Maria, his loyal, ambitious dresser, who, with the help of the king's mistress, ends the long ban on female performers, thus destroying Ned's career. In spite of a sludgy Sunday-brunch score and a weak performance from Ms. Danes, the film explores its period with rare precision and with a lively sense of intellectual curiosity. Much of this is squandered, though, in a flat and conventional final act that turns Ned and Maria into the inventors of Method acting and, recoiling from its earlier subtlety, celebrates a world where men are men and women are women.  SCOTT    'SURVIVING CHRISTMAS' Starring Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Catherine O'Hara and Christina Applegate, Directed by Mike Mitchell (PG-13, 130 minutes). Hollywood's fizzled opening salvo in the year's seasonal sweepstakes, at first appears to have found a clever way to use Ben Affleck's disagreeable qualities. The actor's sharklike grin, cocky petulance and bullying frat-boy swagger befit his character, a hot-shot millionaire ad man marketing spiked eggnog. Adrift at Christmas, he pays the hostile strangers who live in the house in which he grew up to give him the perfect family Christmas he never had. As you watch the comedy lurch along, the woozy, sinking sensation it produces suggests a movie slapped together after the consumption of far too many gallons of that spiked eggnog.  HOLDEN    * 'TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE' With the voices of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Directed by Mr. Parker (R, 98 minutes). Without question the finest R-rated puppet action-musical of the past decade. Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone, the creators of ''South Park,'' apply their foulmouthed ingenuity to blow-'em-up cinema and current geopolitics. Saddam Hussein, a key character in the ''South Park'' movie, has been replaced by Kim Jong Il, a bespectacled blend of Eric Cartman and Professor Chaos, who plots to arm terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. If that doesn't sound like a laughing matter, fear not: there are plenty of profane, catchy songs and giddily offensive jokes to keep you amused. But like any good satire, this film has a distinct moral point of view. The members of Team America, the square-jawed action heroes who take on Kim and his supporting cast of left-wing Hollywood stooges, may blow up a lot of stuff, but they do it by accident, not by design. And while the movie is happy to mock American bluster, it also expresses a blunt, uncynical patriotism.  SCOTT    * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade.  DARGIS    Rock/Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * PURNA DAS BAUL, Queens Theater in the Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park near Exit 9E, Grand Central Parkway, (718) 760-0064 or (212) 545-7536. Purna das Baul is the best-known singer among the Bauls of Bengal, a sect of wandering mistrels whose repertory has been handed down for centuries: rousing, clear-cut folk tunes driven by handclaps and drums. Tomorrow afternoon at 2; admission is $25, $20 for World Music Institute members.  JON PARELES    * CALIFONE, Brooklyn Fire Proof Inc., 101 Richardson Street, top floor, near Meeker Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 302-4702. This tangled-roots indie-rock group finds unexpected connections between wriggly, freeform experiments and rattling, everything-in-the-junkyard folk music; the leader Tom Rutili loves to leave an unexpectedly pretty song half-buried in the debris. (Fans of weird, late-period Wilco should seek out Califone's lovely 2003 album, ''Quicksand/Cradlesnakes.'') The band's performance celebrates the opening of ''Series Two and Three,'' an exhibit of ''artwork from some of today's finest independent musicians,'' including Devendra Banhart, Tara Jane O'Neil, Jon Langford, Jad Fair and Mr. Rutili himself. Tonight at 10, with Bro. Danielson; admission is $10.  KELEFA SANNEH    * CHOCOLATE GENIUS, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Marc Anthony Thompson, a k a Chocolate Genius, writes desolate, telling, unsparing songs full of goodbyes. His husky voice brings long-suffering passion to his twilit ballads, while his banter between songs can switch into comedy. Sunday night at 9:30; tickets are $15.  PARELES    * FELIX DA HOUSECAT, Avalon, 660 Avenue of the Americas, at 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 807-7780. His new-wavey recent album, ''Devin Dazzle & the Neon Fever'' (Emperor Norton), is something of a disappointment: it has plenty of tongue-in-cheek glamour and a even a handful of smartly written songs, but his continuing obsession with the sights and sounds of 1980's nightlife is starting to seem like a joke in search of a punchline. Still, tonight you can expect the usual: one of the country's most entertaining D.J.'s, spinning a casual set full of robotic dance tracks and vocal-driven originals. Tomorrow night after 10; admission is $35, with costume, $25.  SANNEH    * CONVERGE/CAVE IN, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Two Massachusetts bands stake out their own directions for the evolution of hard rock. Converge plays high-speed, high-impact rock that merges the fury of hardcore with the precision of math-metal. Cave In reaches back to psychedelia for ringing guitars and expansive melodies, adding its own kind of emotional turbulence. Tonight and tomorrow night at 6:30, with Between the Buried and Me opening; tickets are $12.  PARELES    CYPRESS HILL, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224 and Starland Ballroom, 570 Jernee Mill Road, Sayreville, N.J., (732) 238-5500. In a nagging singsong that has grown steadily less amusing as the years roll by, B-Real of Cypress Hill tells tales of pot-smoking, gunplay, paranoia and more pot-smoking. The formula is nearly threadbare. At Roseland tonight at 6:45, with the Alchemist and Lordz of Brooklyn opening; admission is $30. At Starland Ballroom tonight at 8; tickets are $23.  PARELES    * OSCAR D'LEON, Copacabana, 560 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-2672. Oscar D'Leon, a suavely forceful singer and a bass-twirling bandleader from Venezuela, leads a high-powered dance band that holds on to the best aspects of 1970's and 1980's salsa. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is $25, members, $10.  PARELES    * DRESDEN DOLLS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Keyboards, drums and Amanda Palmer's flamboyant voice are all the Dresden Dolls need to plunge into songs full of desperate passion and gothic extravagance: sometimes brutal, sometimes comic, always riveting. Tonight at 10:30, with Count Zero at 9:30 and the Ditty Bops at 8:30; admission is $15.  PARELES    * STEVE EARLE, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-1600. Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Steve Earle's America is a place full of mavericks, outcasts and stubborn hope. His voice is scarred and raspy and his band is well rooted and far-reaching, playing generous sets that range across country and rock, from bluegrass to psychedelia. With the election impending, he's likely to draw on his politically tinged songs like the title track of his new album, ''The Revolution Starts Now'' (Artemis). At Webster Hall tomorrow night, with the gutsy country-rocker Allison Moorer sharing the bill; doors open at 6, and tickets are $30. At the Bowery Ballroom on Sunday night at 10:15, with the raunchy country evangelism of Tammy Faye Starlite at 9; tickets are $35.  PARELES    THE FLOWERS, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. A 35th-anniversary reunion for this pioneering dissident rock band from what was the Soviet Union. Tonight at 11:30; tickets are $50.  PARELES    GOGOL BORDELLO, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Gogol Bordello, led by a gruff and extravagantly mustachio'd Ukrainian singer, Eugene Hutz, calls itself a gypsy punk band. Translating Eastern European cabaret to the Lower East Side, its songs work up to a frenetic oom-pah that's the makings of a rowdy party. Tomorrow night; doors open at 8, with Slavic Soul Party and Main Squeeze sharing the bill; tickets are $23.50 in advance, $25 tomorrow.  PARELES    * GREEN DAY, Continental Airlines Arena, the Meadowlands, Route 120, East Rutherford, N.J., (201)935-3900. Green Day put punk-pop on the charts a decade ago, and just in time to prevent the style from becoming completely twerpy, they have released ''American Idiot,'' no less than a rock opera about modern American culture that's as passionate as it is ambitious. Tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $33.  PARELES    HALLOWEEN CREEPSHOW, Spirit, 530 West 27th Street, near 10th Avenue, Chelsea, (212) 268-9477. A Halloween day installment of the long-running New York City rock 'n' roll DJ party (its name won't be appearing in these pages any time soon), starring a fistful of D.J.'s and -- one hopes -- some cleverly-attired revelers. In the main room, you can expect to hear ''possessed rock 'n' roll, puke-green punk, nosferatu new-wave & devilish disco'': the usual, in other words. Here's hoping for at least one tasteless Ray Charles costume, and at least one even-more-tasteless Christopher Reeve. Sunday night at 10; admission is $20, or $15 in advance. But be warned: even if you have a ticket, you have to get dressed up or you won't get in.  SANNEH    HERMAN'S HERMITS/MICKEY DOLENZ/GARY LEWIS AND THE PLAYBOYS/SPENCER DAVIS GROUP, Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y. (516) 334-0800. From both sides of the Atlantic, 1960's oldies reflecting the aftermath of the British Invasion. Tonight at 8; tickets are $41.50.  PARELES    * BRUCE HORNSBY, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536. Bruce Hornsby, who spent much of the 1990's touring as the pianist with the Grateful Dead and its spinoffs, and the experience transformed his own music. Even in earnest songs, he's freer and more playful, letting loose his two-handed virtuosity so that songs dance through jazz, gospel, country, Latin music and rock. Tonight at 8; tickets are $35 and $45.  PARELES    INTI-ILLIMANI, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 576-1155. Inti-Illimani, from Chile, is fond of both traditional Andean music and the hybrids that layer together native American, Spanish and African elements. With traditional flutes, panpipes, percussion and charango (small guitar) alongside clarinets and fiddle, the group's repertory includes new songs in courtly, old-fashioned styles along with traditional tunes. Tonight at 8 and 10; tickets are $25.  PARELES    JET/THE DONNAS, Supper Club, 240 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 921-1940. Choose your 1970's throwback: the early part of the decade for the swaggering, riffing AC/DC revival of Jet or the late 1970's of the Runaways for the punk-pop of the Donnas. Tonight at 8; tickets: $25. Sold out; returns may be available.  PARELES    * LADYFEST EAST, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. A punk-inspired festival featuring a wide range of music, art, film, poetry, theater and comedy by women. (For a full schedule, and for information on festival passes, visit www.ladyfesteast.org.) Tonight at 8, the headliner is the barebones blues-punk band the Gossip; tickets are $13. Tomorrow night at 7:30, the headliner is the Butchies, known for their (sometimes deceptively) straightforward punkish love songs; tickets are $13. Sunday at noon; the headliner is the Richmon, Va., emo band Del Cielo; tickets are $10.  SANNEH    * MEDESKI, MARTIN AND WOOD/ANTIBALAS, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. Medeski, Martin and Wood's jams can take them in any direction, from old-fashioned funk organ trio to free jazz, but they know how to keep the dance floor happy. Antibalas gets its funk by way of Nigeria, where Fela Kuti concocted Afrobeat to meld politics and propulsion; it's a large band that has made Fela's burly grooves its own. Sunday night, doors open at 6; tickets are $32.  PARELES    PBS, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Broadcasting funk from New Orleans, PBS is the Funky Meters minus the keyboardist Art Neville; it includes George Porter Jr. on bass, Russell Batiste on drums and Brian Stoltz on guitar, with some guest musicians. Tonight at midnight; tickets are $25.  PARELES    * ROBERT RANDOLPH AND THE FAMILY BAND/KAKI KING/CITIZEN COPE, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-1224. Until a few years ago, Robert Randolph did most of his performing at the House of God church in Orange, N. J., playing gospel songs on pedal steel guitar. But Mr. Randolph's group has emerged into the secular realm of jam bands, which have embraced both his rip-roaring virtuosity and his gift for making his instrument sing without a word. Sharing the bill are Kaki King, a virtuoso acoustic guitarist, and Citizen Cope, who songs often moan like slow Southern rock. Tomorrow night at 6:45; admission is $25.  PARELES    * DANNY TENAGLIA, Ikon, 610 West 56th Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-8282. Mr. Tenaglia is one of the city's greatest and most reliable -- and most relentless -- house music D.J.'s. Expect a long, delirious night: Mr. Tenaglia is beloved not only for his catholic approach to dance music, but for his extraordinary stamina, too. Tonight after 10; tickets are $25 in advance, more at the door.  SANNEH    * GLENN TILBROOK AND FLUFFERS, THE SMITHEREENS, MARSHALL CRENSHAW, GRAHAM PARKER, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Survivors from the pop side of new wave rock gather in a concert that should be filled with smart lyrics and succinct tunes. The lineup features Glenn Tilbrook, who was the higher, smoother singer and half of the songwriting partnership of Squeeze; the Smithereens, who put just a little punk muscle into folk-rock; Marshall Crenshaw, whose songs seem to roll off the guitar in a casual blend of pre-1970's styles, and Graham Parker, once a cantankerous pub-rocker whose recent songs come to terms with the disappointments and contentments of adulthood. Tonight at 7; admission is $60.  PARELES    * ANGIE STONE/ANTHONY HAMILTON, Newark Symphony Hall, 1020 Broad Street, Newark, (973) 643-8009. On albums, neo-soul is hemmed in by trying to sound like brittle, hop-hop-flavored rhythm-and-blues. Onstage, singers can get more intimate and more dynamic. Angie Stone sings her tales of tough-minded affection with gutsy directness, not bothering with distracting vocal gymnastics. Anthony Hamilton's version of neo-soul doesn't bother with vocal gymastics. Mr. Hamilton, who sings about love, loyalty and growing up in the South, and on stage he lets loose the revival-tent fervor of old Southern soul. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $56.50 and $76.50.  PARELES    * SWEET HONEY IN THE ROCK, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Gospel, blues, African rhythms, protest songs and the joys of harmony are the enduring touchstones of this a cappella group of women, who never forget to leaven righteousness with pleasure. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $23 to $68.  PARELES    SWITCHFOOT, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. A little grunge, a little new wave and a lot of positive thinking and Christian imagery add up to the songs of Switchfoot, which has a religious answer for its existential yearning. Tonight at 7, with the Honorary Title and the Format opening; tickets are $22.  PARELES    TABOU COMBO, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Tabou Combo has been around since the 1960's; it transferred the lilt of the Haitian compas from big bands to a small group with guitars and keyboards, and it suavely segues funk and salsa back to the gentle bounce of the compas. Tonight at 11, with Zin; tickets are $22.  PARELES    * TIGER LILLIES, Peter Jay Sharpe Theater, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, Manhattan, (212) 864-5400.If Kurt Weill had come out of English music halls, and had some grotesque nightmares along the way, his music might sound like the macabre and bouncy tunes of the Tiger Lillies. It's a trio that features Martyn Jacques's hooting accordion and piercing falsetto in tales of outcasts, addicts, hustlers and ghouls, perfect for Halloween. Sunday at 8; tickets are $25, $23 for members.  PARELES    THE WAILERS, B.B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Three members of the band that backed Bob Marley -- Al Anderson on guitar, Earl Wya Lindo on keyboards and Aston Barrett on bass -- are still the core of the Wailers, whose rhythms transformed reggae and rock forever. Tonight and tomorrow at 8; tickets are $20 in advance, $25 the day of the show.  PARELES    * THE WALKMEN, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, Manhattan, (212) 353-1600.The Walkmen, one of New York City's finest bands, put a frazzled edge on songs that have absorbed New York rock from the Velvet Underground and electric Bob Dylan to the Ramones and the Contortions. They have the jangle of too much caffeine after too little sleep, in songs that sound like arguments that won't end. It's brawny, bristling rock with a point to every loose end. Tonight, doors open at 7 and the Hackensaw Boys and Walking Stalking Walters share the bill; tickets are $20.  PARELES    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    WES ANDERSON/KENGO NAKAMURA QUARTET, Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212)  885-7000. Wes Anderson has been an alto saxophonist in the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra and in Wynton Marsalis's own groups since the late 1980's; he's got a clean, sweet, flexible style that can remind you of Cannonball Adderley. He leads the band with Kengo Nakamura, a bassist who's been playing around New York since the 90's in bands led by Cyrus Chestnut, Benny Golson and others. Tonight at 9 and 10:45; cover charge is $10.  BEN RATLIFF    BRUCE BARTH TRIO, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Mr. Barth, who has made a series of fine, if overlooked, records since leaving Terence Blanchard's group a decade ago, is a reliable index of what the best of modern, mainstream jazz piano playing sounds like. He swings as much as possible and doesn't let the music get away from him. But he also brings a degree of percussive aggression to the music that sounds even more powerful inside these boundaries. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    * BRASIL LIVRE! Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500. The Brazilian multi-instrumentalist and composer Hermeto Pascoal, a real outside-the-box thinker and cult hero in hardcore jazz circles, doesn't perform in America much. It's a coup to have him for two nights in Rose Hall's Allen Room in the new Jazz at Lincoln Center complex. He performs on a bill with Beat the Donkey, a boisterous percussion ensemble led by the Brazilian-born percussionist Cyro Baptista. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30; tickets are $10 to $150.  RATLIFF    RON CARTER NONET/REGINA CARTER QUARTET, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. Mr. Carter, the bassist, never quits readjusting his focus, from classical to Brazilian to straight-ahead jazz. Ms. Carter, the classically trained violinist, has been pretty successful at mixing virtuosity with popular appeal: when she makes blues and gospel figures out of portamento swoops, it's hard not to like her. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge is $35 and a $5 minimum.  RATLIFF    JIMMY COBB'S MOB, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. One of the original hard-bop drummers and the only surviving musician from Miles Davis's ''Kind of Blue'' sessions, Jimmy Cobb plays hard-edged, straight-ahead jazz with his own band. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20.  RATLIFF    DIZZY GILLESPIE FESTIVAL, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595. The second week of the mini-festival celebrating both this new club's opening and Dizzy Gillespie's birthday. Its theme is Gillespie's big band repertory, and Paquito D'Rivera Sextet is playing it. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30 with a $10 minimum at the tables and a $5 minimum at the bar.  RATLIFF    * CHARLIE HADEN QUINTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Following up ''Nocturne,'' a record of Cuban boleros, the great jazz bassist Mr. Haden has created ''Land of the Sun'' (Verve), an album of ballads mostly by the Mexican composer Jose Sabre Marroquín. Again, he's got the Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba in his band, and together they render the emotion of the bolero finely-wrought lowercase. There is beauty and incredible tension here; the music from ''Nocturne'' was even better in performance and probably this will be, too. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    MULGREW MILLER AND WINGSPAN, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Mr. Miller has a soulful sensitivity that made him the reliable standard for mainstream jazz piano over the last 20 years. He's not a housewrecker; he just sets his music in order and knows what to do. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25 and $20 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    'VISION CLUB': JOE MORRIS, CHARLES GAYLE, ET AL., Vision Club, Brunstein Showroom, 13 Stanton Street, between Chrystie and Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681. A new concert series continues, creating different pairings within experimental jazz. At 8 p.m., the guitarist Joe Morris plays in a trio with Louis Belogenis and Rashid Bakr, and at 10, Charles Gayle's trio takes over, with the bassist Hill Greene and the drummer Lou Grassi. Tomorrrow night; admission is $10 per set or $15 for the night.  RATLIFF    * ERIC REVIS'S 11:11, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. The bassist Eric Revis is best known as a member of Branford Marsalis's quartet, and he's just recently put out a record with a wide, persuasive vision; the hard rhythm is always there, but he's been listening to Bill Frisell, Ornette Coleman and a lot of other things. His band is a wrecking crew: the harmonica player Gregoire Maret, the saxophonist John Ellis, the guitarist Oz Noy and the drummer Jeff Watts. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 10:30; cover charge is $15.  RATLIFF    MELVIN RHYNE ORGAN TRIO, Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369. A dependable Hammond organ player who used to play with Wes Montgomery. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 10:30, midnight, 1:30 and 2:30; cover charge is $15.  RATLIFF    ANDY SUMMERS TRIO, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Midtown, (212) 581-3080. Some years after the Police broke up, the band's guitarist dived into a jazz career, starting to put out albums reflecting his interest in most of the things working jazz musicians are concerned with -- Mingus and Monk and Brazilian music, among others. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 with a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    * KAREN AKERS, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212) 308-9455. Ms. Akers brings back ''Time After Time,'' her acclaimed salute to the traditional love song. Demure and statuesque with an air of aristocratic reserve, she retains the formality of a concert performer while delivering beautifully intoned, deeply felt versions of standards that include ''I'm Old Fashioned,'' ''Falling in Love With Love,'' ''Time After Time'' and ''Loving You.'' It is as romantically satisfying a cabaret show as you'll ever find. Don Rebic accompanies on piano. Tonight through Sunday night at 8, with a late show tomorrow night at 10:30. Cover $50 tonight and tomorrow night, $35 on Sunday; no minimum.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.  HOLDEN    BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at one least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $90.  HOLDEN    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'AIDA' The Metropolitan Opera often succeeds in making a spectacle of itself; at least the spectacle is warranted in Verdi's ''Aida,'' which was originally conceived as grand opera. Everyone involved in the current revival can more or less make the thing fly, led by Dolora Zajick as an Amneris whose ringing mezzo threatens to blow everyone else offstage, and the excellent Marcello Viotti in the pit. A couple of new singers step into the cast tonight: Angela M. Brown takes on the title role and Anooshah Golesorkhi brings his firm baritone to the part of her father, Amonasro. Add a few armies of dancers and horses and you could have a fine old time. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200.  ANNE MIDGETTE    'CARMEN' Over the years, Bizet's gritty opéra-comique has succumbed to edema, and Franco Zeffirelli's Metropolitan Opera production suffers especially from bloat and stiffness, dealing in archetypes rather than living, breathing figures. Some new singers have stepped into the lead roles of this revival: Irina Mishura takes on Carmen; and Eduardo Villa sings Don José. Rounding out the cast are Hei-Kyung Hong, a lyrical Micaëla, and the worthy newcomer Ildar Abdrazakov as Escamillo. An additional tenor will be present in the pit: Plácido Domingo, tending his second (or is it third) career as a conductor. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215.  MIDGETTE    'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' Opera audiences and opera companies never tire of pairing Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci,'' surely the most popular one-act Italian operas ever, in a double bill. Franco Zeffirelli's scrupulously realistic production returns to the Metropolitan Opera tomorrow afternoon. Aside from the intriguing casting of the powerhouse Russian tenor Vladimir Galouzine as Canio in ''Pagliacci,'' once Caruso's signature role, the casting looks solid and promising, with Juan Pons as Tonio and Daniela Dessì as Nedda in ''Pagliacci,'' along with Eva Urbanova as Santuzza and Fabio Armiliato as Turiddu in ''Cavalleria.'' The main interest should be the conducting of Dennis Russell Davies. Over the years New York audiences have mostly heard him in orchestra programs with a bracing quotient of contemporary works. But Mr. Davies has been a major presence in European opera houses. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    'DIALOGUES OF THE CARMELITES' Poulenc's elegant meditation on death, in this new and blessedly simple New York City Opera production by Tazewell Thompson, continues its run tonight. Poulenc, the charming boulevardier and tasteful sentimentalist, turns his attention here to serious matters: namely faith, martyrdom and the French Revolution. George Manahan conducts. The largely female cast includes Rinat Shaham, Sarah Coburn, Joyce Castle, Eugenie Grunewald, Gwynne Geyer and Gloria Parker. Worth a trip. At 8 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105.  BERNARD HOLLAND    'THE SATIN CLOAK' Martin Halpern's pleasant little folk-parable opera about a cobbler who becomes a ruler had its premiere at the minute company Operaworks in 2001; now, Mimi Stern-Wolfe, an indefatigable presenter of opera and music on a shoestring for the last 20 years, is presenting a new production of the piece with her Downtown Chamber Players. Possible improvements include the addition of live musical accompaniment (as opposed to Operaworks's ''virtual orchestra'') and September Bigelow, a rich-voiced young mezzo-soprano, in the role of the cobbler's wife. It remains to be seen if Mr. Halpern, who will also direct, can match the antic charm of the original production. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $21, $12 for 65+ and students.  MIDGETTE    'LA TRAVIATA' Verdi's drama is so well written that a singer who can manage to get through the difficult title role is virtually guaranteed a success. At City Opera, Maria Kanyova attacks Violetta with a will and negotiates the role's hurdles with a kind of fierce vivacity, down to a brief but solid high E-flat at the end of ''Sempre libera'' in Act I. Since the start of this revival in September, she's been joined by some new men in her life: Grant Youngblood, who should be a fine, strong Germont, and Eric Fennell as Alfredo. Atsushi Yamada conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $115.  MIDGETTE    Classical Music    EMANUELE ARCIULI Since his American debut in 1998 in Cincinnati, the Italian pianist Emanuele Arciuli has performed almost every season in New York, attracting attention and audiences in particular for his brilliant and probing performances of contemporary music. Two years ago at Columbia University's Miller Theater he presented ''Round Monk Variations,'' the results of a commissioning project in which he asked some 20 composers to write works in response to Thelonious Monk's jazz classic ''Round Midnight.'' Tonight Mr. Arciuli is back at Columbia for a recital of 20th- century works by, among others, Cage, Feldman, John Adams, Karlheinz Stockhausen and a world premiere by Alessandro Sbordoni. You can expect Mr. Arciuli's playing to be as compelling as his program is adventurous. Tonight at 6:30, Casa Italiana, Columbia University, 1161 Amsterdam Avenue, between 116th and 118th Streets, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-4437. Free.  TOMMASINI    BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. This weekend, the small stage of the barge will be crowded with the Knights of the Many-Sided Table, a 10-piece chamber ensemble formed by young, up-and-coming New York-based string players. Tonight's program features the perennially popular Serenade for Strings by Tchaikovsky alongside Armenian folk songs and music by Shostakovich. Tomorrow and Sunday, the Knights are joined at their proverbial table by the accomplished flutist Paula Robison in music by Ginastera, Bartok and others. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $75.  JEREMY EICHLER    CHOIR OF CORPUS CHRISTI CHURCH AND PARTHENIA The Music Before 1800 series presents a handful of superb early music ensembles from around the world, but not to be overlooked are the illuminating programs by the resident Choir of Corpus Christi Church, conducted by Louise Basbas. On Sunday, the choir is supported by Parthenia, a fine viol consort, in music by Monteverdi, Viadana, Wert, Salamone Rossi and both Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli. Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266. Tickets: $25 and $40; $20 and $35 for students and 62+.  ALLAN KOZINN    THE ENGLISH CONCERT This pioneering period-instrument group, based in London, was big in the 1970's and 80's, but it seemed to lose steam toward the end of Trevor Pinnock's tenure as founding director. If anyone can re-energize it, it should be the electrifying violinist Andrew Manze, its new leader. Several Vivaldi concertos will afford ample display of Mr. Manze's virtuosity here. The other repertory ranges from the overfamiliar (Mozart's ''Kleine Nachtmusik'') to the obscure (a serenata by Johann Heinrich Schmelzer). Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $56.  JAMES R. OESTREICH    JUILLIARD SYMPHONY James DePreist, the music director of the Oregon Symphony for many years (and now its laureate music director), recently took over the conducting and orchestral studies programs at the Juilliard School. A concert with the school's orchestra last year showed the considerable degree of promise this collaboration holds, and tonight, Mr. DePreist leads the Juilliard Symphony in a program that should challenge the school's young musicians. Included are Christopher Rouse's Symphony No. 1, Weber's Bassoon Concerto and a hefty chunk of Wagner, including ''Ride of the Valkyries,'' the ''Prelude and Liebestod'' from ''Tristan und Isolde,'' and the ''Immolation Scene'' from ''Götterdämerung.'' Tonight at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406. Free, but reservations are required.  KOZINN    MOSCOW VIRTUOSI This dependably good chamber orchestra often showcases the music of its home country, but in this case Shostakovich is the lone Russian composer on the program. Still, there should be plenty of other riches to compensate including Schoenberg's ravishing ''Verklärte Nacht'' and the memorable Sextet from Strauss's ''Capriccio.'' With the eloquent Vladimir Spivakov at the helm, the group certainly need not hire outside violin soloists. Instead, Mr. Spivakov will play Mozart's Second Violin Concerto (K. 211) as well as Bach's Concerto for Violin and Oboe (BWV 1060). Sunday afternoon at 3, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $12 to $54.  EICHLER    * PAMELA Z Think Meredith Monk meets ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' and you'll get some inkling of the sound of ''Voci,'' an evening-length work by the classically trained vocalist and performance artist Pamela Z that's having its first New York performances. Based in San Francisco, acclaimed internationally, Ms. Z explores a wide range of sounds: some made with her own voice, spoken or sung, and some created through sampling or electronic processing. ''Voci,'' a multi-media, evening-length piece, focuses on her instrument of preference, exploring various permutations of the human voice, including some virtual duets with Ms. Z and other performers who appear as video samples. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793. Tickets: $15; $12 for students and 65+.  MIDGETTE    ST. PETERSBURG PHILHARMONIC This is the third of the orchestra's three concerts at Carnegie Hall. The music has been, and continues to be, Russian. Lynn Harrell (not Russian) is the soloist in the Shostakovich Cello Concerto. Yuri Temirkanov conducts it and Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Russian Easter'' Overture and the Tchaikovsky Sixth Symphony as well. Tonight at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $29 to $115.

AMERICAN BALLET THEATER The company's autumn season, which continues through Nov. 7, features a rich assortment of one-act works ideally suited for a space in which dramatic details come into vivid focus. Tomorrow night, Marcelo Gomes plays Henry VIII in ''VIII'' and Carmen Corella and Xiomara Reyes are two of his doomed wives, while Paloma Herrera makes her debut in that ballet on Sunday night, when Angel Corella and Julie Kent once again portray the other major roles. On Sunday afternoon, Veronika Part and Maxim Beloserkovsky star in the light-hearted ''Angelina Ballerina.'' Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., City Center, West 55th Street, between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212. Tickets: $35 to $80.  JACK ANDERSON    * CHARLES DENNIS: 'HOMECOMING' This documentary celebrates 20 years of dance and ultimate funk at P.S. 122, which Mr. Dennis co-founded. The film focuses on 10 choreographers who created seminal work there, with music by John Zorn, photography by Dona Ann McAdams and commentary by critics and presenters who include Mark Russell, for many years the theater's director and animating spirit. Sunday (and Sundays through Nov. 14) at 2 p.m. P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288. Tickets: $5.  JENNIFER DUNNING    'FOREVER TANGO' Better than Viagra, and for all ages, too. Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' features sultry and comical dancers and first-rate musicians in a show, extended through Nov. 28, that is both tacky and transcendent. Tonight (and Tuesdays and Thursdays) at 8; tomorrow (and Wednesdays) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m., Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $45 to $85.  DUNNING    FRIDAYS AT NOON This free series, which features informal programs of new dances and a chance to question the choreographers, will present work today by Emma Cotter, Barbara Mahler and Rachel Schroeder. Today at noon, 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500 or www.92Y.org.  DUNNING    GRUPO CORPO This Brazilian troupe fuses ballet, jazz, modern-dance and Afro-Brazilian dance styles in choreography and performing that has been praised for its sensuality and energy. Samba, anyone, with a Martha Graham contraction? Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30; Sunday at 2:30 p.m., New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722 or www.njpac.org. Tickets: $38.  DUNNING    MANDANCE PROJECT Eliot Feld's new choreographic endeavor brings together five men (Damian Woetzel, Wu-Kang Chen, Nickemil Concepcion, Jason Jordan and Sean Suozzi) and one woman (Patricia Tuthill) in solos, duets and group works by Mr. Feld to music ranging from Bach to jug band tunes. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tomorrow at 2 and Sunday at 3 p.m. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $42; matinees, $25 for adults, $15 for children.  ANDERSON    * MERIÁN SOTO DANCE & PERFORMANCE Ms. Soto's new ''Máquina del Tiempo'' (''Time Machine'') is a full-evening piece in three parts that explores popular dance and music forms as ''time machines,'' which reveal much about their eras. The multi-media piece draws on post-modern dance and the improvisational salsa, hip-hop, swing and mambo. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $25.  DUNNING    * ÑACHO-ÑACHO GYPSY STORYTELLER Spain and India might not seem to have much in common culturally, but programs of flamenco and Indian classical dance tend to be as exciting as they are intriguingly complementary. Andrea Del Conte will represent flamenco and Narayana Charka will represent Indian classical Kathak dance in a program that explores the rich historical connections between these two old dance forms. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Lotus Studios, 109 West 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 627-1076 or www.lotusarts.com. Tickets: $25.  DUNNING    NEXT WAVE FESTIVAL: RALPH LEMON Mr. Lemon's ambitious cross-cultural ''Geography Trilogy'' concludes with ''Come home Charley Patton,'' a theatrical mosaic that combines dance, music, storytelling, literature and video to examine how memory is passed down from one generation to the next. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100. Tickets: $20 to $45.  ANDERSON    OUT OF SPACE @ BRIC STUDIO Presented by both the studio and the Danspace Project at St. Mark's, the series' program this weekend sounds about as eclectic as you can get. Daman Harun will present a solo exploring place and displacement. Mina Nishimura's solo creates an abstract landscape of experimentation with time and space. Smruti Patel blends Indian classical and American contemporary dance. And the Usaama Dance Company of New Jersey, a group of young girls, will perform West African dance and song. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, BRIC Studio, 57 Rockwell Place, around the corner from the BAM Harvey Theater, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 855-7882. Tickets: $10.  DUNNING    SAINT MICHAEL'S WARRIORS DANCE COMPANY This weekend's wild-card dance attraction, the Bronx-based Warriors fuse biblical stories, Christian messages and hip-hop, ballet, modern and African and jazz dance styles, all performed to rock music. This is their debut. Say you saw them when. Tonight at 8, All Angels Church, 251 West 80th Street, Manhattan, (347) 675-2392 or www.saintmichaelswarriors.org. Tickets: $12; $8, students and 65+.  DUNNING    SOKOLOW THEATER DANCE ENSEMBLE Anna Sokolow's 50th anniversary as a choreographer will be celebrated here by a program of her dances, including her signature ''Rooms,'' set to live music by a jazz ensemble and performed by dancers directed by Jim May, Sokolow's longtime associate. Tonight through Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    * STREB S.L.A.M. You could say Elizabeth Streb and her performers are sitting pretty, with their own 150-seat studio-theater in which to create new work and regularly present it. But no one sits for long at a Streb program. The dancers fly, dive and dangle in new and recent pieces. The audience can walk around, as at a fairground, with popcorn provided. Tonight and tomorrow (and Fridays and Saturdays through Nov. 20) at 7 p.m.; Sunday (and Sundays through Nov. 21) at 3 p.m., S.L.A.M. (Streb Lab for Action Mechanics), 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 384-6481. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    TRINAYAN COLLECTIVE This New York-based group, which specializes in the sensuous, lyrical Odissi form of Indian classical dance, will present ''Neel: The Eternal Blue,'' a meditation on the divine. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 598-9085. Tickets: $25; $20 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    WORLD MUSIC INSTITUTE: BALE FOLCLORIC DA BAHIA The 30-member Brazilian troupe is known for explosive drumming and frenzied dancing. Batten down the hatches. Tonight at 8, Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or www  .worldmusicinstitute.org. Tickets: $32; $45; $15 for students with identification. The company will perform tomorrow at 8 p.m. at the New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $10 to $48.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    'ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR,' New Museum of Contemporary Art/Chelsea, 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 219-1222, through Nov. 13. Occupying new temporary quarters on the Chelsea Art Museum's ground floor, the New Museum presents a mostly video group show that reflects the problems of adapting to the constant changes of modern experience. Robert Melee's home-entertainment center documents his adaptation to his eccentric mother; a video by Bojan Sarcevic shows a Turkish Gypsy band learning to play Western pop songs; and, best of all, a video by Kerry Tribe shows a wonderfully charismatic 10-year-old girl thoughtfully responding to philosophical questions posed by a man off camera. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3.  KEN JOHNSON    * 'JOSEF AND ANNI ALBERS: DESIGNS FOR LIVING,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This enlightening, quietly excellent show is the first to juxtapose the design efforts -- his furniture, her textiles -- of two remarkable artists who happened to be married to each other. Instead of Josef's paintings of glowing nesting squares, which presage Minimalism, we get his 1927 nesting tables with the same meticulous sense of color, proportion and geometry that he would later apply to canvas. Anni brought a similarly intelligent structure to fabrics and tapestries that make every thread, texture and color count, at once exposing and exalting her medium's basic grid. She was the Sol LeWitt of weaving. Reflecting design moving toward art by dint of formidable concentration on its own purposes and potentials, this show may rearrange some ideas about early modernist design as well as Minimalist art and furniture. Hours: Tuesdays to Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7.  ROBERTA SMITH    * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Ave., at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined elements of East and West, high and low, old and new: African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. Literature and music shaped the work no less than Picasso, George Grosz and Vermeer did. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.  MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphosing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry, and in one astonishing small sculpture, a human face splits apart to reveal the ages of man. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  HOLLAND COTTER    'THE BISHOP JADES,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through January 2006. Jade has always been imbued with moral and spiritual meaning in China. Luminous and quick to warm to the touch, it must have seemed heaven sent when first discovered, embedded in boulders washed down from mountains in Central Asia. Yet because it is unusually hard, direct carving was all but impossible. Slow abrasion was the only way to manipulate it. It has been treasured since ancient time, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. They range in size from two-inch-high figurines of astrological creatures to a hefty green basin modeled on an even larger one made for Kublai Khan. In style they run from a no-frills, starched-white incense burner with a fluted surface to a couple of all-frills vases with dragons perched on the rim and fruit spilling down the side. Also included are jade versions of archaic bronzes, a reminder of the fundamental conservatism of Chinese art, and examples of Indian Mughal jades of a kind Qing connoisseurs flipped over. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.  COTTER    * 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China; a few were unearthed as recently as last year. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. There are a few monumental sculptures; most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small, but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. It's a show that asks you to do some work, but there is so much of interest to look at that no one, even the casual drive-by viewer, will feel shortchanged. Hours and admission: see above.  COTTER    * 'COLONIAL ANDES: TAPESTRIES AND SILVERWORK, 1530-1830,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Dec. 12. This sumptuous, groundbreaking show examines the fruitful cultural collision triggered by the Spanish conquest of the highly developed Incan empire in 1532. Their forced mixing resulted in a third hybrid culture that reached its zenith in two indigenous crafts: metalwork and, especially, tapestry weaving, which the Andean people perfected over 100 years. Beginning with the gorgeously geometric pre-Colonial tunics and mantles worn by the Inca elite, this exhibition traces the progressive absorption and adjustment of Renaissance and Baroque styles from Europe. The silverwork has an astounding roiling energy that seems to reflect the metal's abundance. Hours and admission: see above.  SMITH    * 'COMIC GROTESQUE: WIT AND MOCKERY IN GERMAN ART, 1870-1940,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 14. The horrors of World War I are usually credited with triggering the dark, often scathing humor that was used to comment on and combat some very unfunny developments in Germany in the first four decades of the century. But the Neue Galerie's splendidly multimedia revisionist show takes a broader view. It pinpoints paintings by Arnold Böcklin from the 1870's as a point of origin and then sweeps forward in a selective yet encompassing manner, touching on painting, poetry, graphic design and popular entertainment. It shows the influences of the satiric illustrator Thomas Theodor Heine on the mordant anti-Nazi montages of John Heartfield; places artists like Lionel Feininger and Alfred Kubin in context; and includes reconstructions of puppets made and used in performance by Heartfield, George Grosz and Hannah Höch. It culminates in the films of the great Karl Valentin, the star of stage, screen and cabaret who was Germany's Charlie Chaplin. Saturdays to Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7.  SMITH    * 'DESIGN IS NOT ART: FUNCTIONAL OBJECTS FROM DONALD JUDD TO RACHEL WHITEREAD,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This bracingly contentious but spatially challenged and cursory show is worth seeing, if only because it is the first in an American museum to survey the functional and semifunctional objects designed during the last three decades by artists, in this case 18 well-known Minimalists, post-Minimalists and post-post-Minimalists. The show is overdue, which also makes it seem late, as it ignores many younger artists. It also resembles a high-end home furnishings store. Points of interest are few: Richard Tuttle's lamps, John Chamberlain's carved foam couch, Joel Shapiro's side tables, crystal tumblers by Sol LeWitt and, above all, Franz West's decorate-it-yourself table and chairs. The only designs that seem likely to last are those of Donald Judd, who presides over the exhibition as Picasso would over a survey of Cubism. Hours and admission: see above.  SMITH    'DON'T CALL IT PERFORMANCE,' Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, through Nov. 7. Performative seems to be the preferred term now for performance art, to distinguish it from theater. Whatever, it's alive and kicking here, with short videos by 30 artists, mostly Latino or Latin American but including some North American and European colleagues, on view. They are grouped in five categories, dealing with behavior; meditative and spiritual explorations; pop culture; social and political views; and sound, including language and music. The work is uneven, but you do get a sense that a younger generation is keeping performative work a vital presence in the art world. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; $4 for students and 65+.  GRACE GLUECK    'EUROPEAN BRONZES FROM THE QUENTIN COLLECTION,' the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, through Jan. 2. During the last few decades there has been a revival of interest in the collection and technical exploration of small-scale bronzes from the Renaissance, depicting gods, goddesses, religious figures, nymphs, fauns, satyrs, animals and simple folk. About 35 of these statuettes, from the 15th to the mid-18th centuries and assembled by an Argentine collector, star in this lively show. Originally inspired by mythological themes or classical marble statuary, and often reconstructed in innovative ways by well-known artists, the statuettes were eagerly sought by European connoisseurs, who admired their masterly modeling, subtle surfacing and elegant finishes. Happily, these bronzes are displayed without vitrines, so they can be examined closely from every angle. Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for 62+; $5 for students.  GLUECK    * 'FIRST AMERICAN ART: THE CHARLES AND VALERIE DIKER COLLECTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ART,' National Museum of the American Indian, George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700, through October 2005. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Diker Collection. Masks, baskets, pots, clothing, baby carriers, painted hides, drawings and other treasures are displayed here not as ethnological artifacts, but as objects of art. The works are as beautiful as any you are likely to find in a private holding. The show affirms the distance achieved in allotting American Indian art a worthy aesthetic place in world culture. Hours: daily, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays until 8 p.m. Free.  GLUECK    'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. And in these portraits, mostly of upper-class offspring, to be sure, he tended to get more real. This show, presenting about 40 works on the subject, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how Sargent's likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood that came into play at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first exhibition to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show, with its catalog, is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 62+, $4.  GLUECK    *  'IN THE REALM OF GODS AND KINGS: ARTS OF INDIA SELECTIONS FROM THE POLSKY COLLECTIONS AND THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART,' through Jan. 2, and 'WHEN GOLD BLOSSOMS: INDIAN JEWELRY FROM THE COLLECTION OF SUSAN L. BENINGSON,' through Jan. 23, Asia Society and Museum, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400. Of these two collection shows, ''In the Realm of Gods and Kings'' is the more varied. Made up mostly of small, precious objects, it leaps from ancient sculpture to contemporary photography, but concentrates on miniature paintings from the 16th through the 19th centuries. It's a visually stunning, speeded-up trip through a high-end version of Indian art, and intellectually stimulating as a demonstration of how social and spiritual worlds can reflect each other. The jewelry in the Beningson show furthers this idea with lots of razzle and dazzle. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; 65+, $7; students, $5; under 16, free.  COTTER    'THE LANGUAGE OF NATIVE AMERICAN BASKETS,' National Museum of the American Indian, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212) 514-3700, through Jan. 9. Woven by hand from carefully cultivated roots and plants, a basket could be a baby carrier, a saddlebag, a purse, a bowl for cooking or serving, a tray, a jar, a water bottle, a fish trap, a trunk, a seed scoop, a hat or even a coffin. This vivacious show presents more than 200 examples of basket making in the museum's collection, going back to the early 19th century. And it also displays work by five present-day practitioners, part of a growing number helping to keep the tradition alive. Besides its aesthetic pleasures, this show provides abundant proof of that tradition's vivacity. Hours and admission: see above.  GLUECK    * 'LOOKING AT LIFE,' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 28. From its start in 1936 until its demise as a weekly magazine in 1972, Life was this country's archive of public memory, supplying millions of Americans, most of them educated, white and middle class, with a collective visual inventory of the world as imagined for Main Street, U.S.A. This entertaining show is a reminder of the many memorable photographs the magazine published, from Robert Capa's pictures of the landing at Normandy Beach and Larry Burrows's bloodied G.I.'s in Vietnam to W. Eugene Smith's Spanish village and Carlo Bavagnoli's shot of Jane Fonda as Barbarella. The big idea is how Life and, by implication, all forms of popular journalism, package news, but in the end the photographs, looked at one by one, speak for themselves. Nina Leen's suburban housewives as exotic species -- under shiny hairdryers or surrounded by their new appliances -- are among the forgotten masterpieces of mid-century Americana. She has one of the show's encapsulating views: a gauzy photograph, from the back, of a mother with two small children in their pajamas, holding hands in the slanting light of the late afternoon on a suburban platform, watching as the train pulls in. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+.  KIMMELMAN    'MASTERPIECES OF AMERICAN JEWELRY,' American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, through Jan. 23. A production of the National Jewelry Institute, this exhibition presents about 150 pieces of exquisite high-quality jewelry from the late 18th century to the late 20th century. Its organization is less than illuminating but individual pieces are marvelous. Included are a Walt Disney Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs charm bracelet; gold nut-and-bolt cufflinks by the witty designer Paul Flato; a diamond, ruby and sapphire American flag brooch the size of a playing card, by Tiffany; and opulent necklaces, bracelets and brooches in various traditional styles from Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels and other famous firms. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; students and 62+, $7.  JOHNSON    * 'MEMORIALS OF WAR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Nov. 28. The Whitney reveals a little-seen aspect of its collection and some interesting new acquisitions in this small but powerful show of works inspired by the Vietnam War. Vic Muniz's recent photographs are ghostly recreations of three of that era's most indelible news photographs. Edward Kienholz and Robert Morris are represented by proposals from around 1970 for unexecuted memorials that emphasize the hard truths of armed combat. Chris Burden restages five of America's ''Darker Moments,'' in tableaus whose toy-soldier scale in no way diminishes shocks and aftershocks of these events. Hours and admission: see above.  SMITH    'GILBERT STUART,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 16. Known today mostly for his multiple images of George Washington, 14 of which are shown here, Stuart (1755-1828) painted many other faces, famous and not, as seen in this full-blown retrospective. Among them were Thomas Jefferson; John and Abigail Adams; the fur magnate John Jacob Astor; John Jay, first chief justice of the United States; the painters Joshua Reynolds, Benjamin West and John Singleton Copley; and doctors, lawyers, clergymen and countless British and American blueboods, their wives, children and dogs. Possessed of a penetrating talent augmented by a knowledge of physiognomy, Stuart apparently sussed out his subjects in lively conversation as he worked. Among the impressive results are the wonderful ''Catherine Brass Yates,'' an exquisite likeness of a middle-aged woman elegantly plying a needle as her long narrow face regards the viewer with a cool stare. ''The Skater (William Grant),'' done in 1782, is a stunning full-length figure of an acquaintance from Stuart's London days performing a graceful maneuver on the ice. It is, far and beyond being a portrait, a haunting work whose liberating air seems to extol the individual as master of his fate. The last Stuart retrospective was held nearly 40 years ago; this one reveals for a new generation that he was and remains one of our greatest American painters. Hours and admission: see above.  GLUECK    Galleries: Uptown    'BOB THE ROMAN: HEROIC ANTIQUITY AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF ROBERT ADAM,' Gallery of the New York School of Interior Design, 161 East 69th Street, (212) 472-1500, through Dec. 4. Not for nothing did the Scotsman Robert Adam (1728-1792) playfully restyle himself ''Bob the Roman'' after soaking up the Eternal City on his youthful grand tour of Europe. Nearly everything he turned his hand to later as the celebrated architect, designer and interior decorator of late 18th-century England evoked the classical spirit of his beloved Rome. This show of more than 80 drawings made in the Adam office (Robert's brother, James, was his partner) is an enlightening introduction to the Adam brothers' scope. The works range from a nine-foot-long view of the facade of an intricate fantasy palace to numerous plans and proposals for town houses, villas and castles, along with their ornamentation, many of which actually got built. The show provides a fine glimpse of Robert Adam's role in helping to put an elegant and decorative new face on 18th-century English architecture.  GLUECK    ALFRED LESLIE: 'EXPRESSING THE ZEITGEIST,' Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through Dec. 22. Although thought of today primarily as a realist painter, Alfred Leslie started out as a second-generation Abstract Expressionist, a mover and shaker of the downtown world whose studio was a center of happenings and other events besides painting. This presentation of his vibrant early work from 1951 to 1962 ranges from tiny collages to large canvases, whose colors, chosen from a broad palette, were energetically laid on with heavy, loaded brushstrokes exuberantly accompanied by drips and spatter. They characteristically carry a pair or two of painted bars that punctuate the highly textured, often collaged surfaces like exclamation points.  GLUECK    * 'NEUE SACHLICHKEIT: NEW OBJECTIVITY IN WEIMAR GERMANY,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through Dec. 18. Heralded by the Expressionist Ludwig Meidner as a ''fanatical, fervent naturalism,'' the ostensibly realist style known as Neue Sachlichkeit was all that and more, as this uneven 80-work show vigorously suggests. It features the majestically factual photographs of August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt and Albert Renger-Patzsch, and works based on photographs by Georg Scholz, Eddy Smith and George Grosz that bring out reality's grotesque side. Carl Grossberg's pared-down, jewel-colored portrayals of German factories and villages evoke American Precisionism.  SMITH    Galleries: SoHo    'THE ART OF READING,' Poets House, 72 Spring Street, (212) 431-7920, through Nov. 22. This appropriately quiet presentation of 38 small paintings, drawings, prints and photographs of people reading includes Paul Cadmus's portrait of Glenway Wescott; David Hockney's sweet colored pencil drawing of a young man reclining on a sofa; photographs of William Burroughs by Allen Ginsberg; and King Babar (the elephant) reading his newspaper at the beach in a watercolor by Laurent DeBrunhoff.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    JEFF LADOUCEUR: 'SCHMO,' ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 229-1088, through Nov. 13. With a finely pointed pen in black ink and a meticulous touch, this Vancouver-based artist draws cartoons about a bald, long-nosed, sad sack of a character called ''Schmo.'' Our hero's struggles with ordinary existence and surrealistic encounters with cloud-creatures, tiny elephants, octopuses and an abominable snowman are funny, weird and touching.  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life.  COTTER    * FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION NATIONAL MONUMENT, Foley Square, Lower Manhattan, (212) 206-6674, through Nov. 13. On a return engagement sponsored by Creative Time and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, this interactive outdoor sculpture, made in the symbolic year 1984, consists of a big, bright red Constructivist-style megaphone, through which members of the public can exercise their right to free speech. The work is a collaboration among the architect Laurie Hawkinson, the artist Erika Rothenberg and the performer John Malpede. It points, perhaps appropriately, toward the state and federal courthouses.  SMITH    'THE PRESIDENCY,' Exit Art, 475 Tenth Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through Nov. 21. Among the few interesting pieces in this weak selection of politically tendentious works by 41 artists are Arbuzo Virtmanis's corrugated cardboard reconstruction of the President's bedroom on Air Force One; a deadpan video cartoon by Packard Jennings in which President Bush and members of his cabinet say things they would say if they were being completely honest; and an audio piece by 31 Down Radio Theater in which the President humbly apologizes for things he has done, from running for president to invading Iraq.  JOHNSON    Last Chance    * 'AUSTRIA WEST: NEW ALPINE ARCHITECTURE' AND 'NEW ALPINE RESIDENCES,' Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, through tomorrow An exciting survey of more than 70 structures -- from hotels to factories -- produced by what amounts to a thriving school of young architects working in the Austrian provinces of Tyrol and Vorarlberg. Their historical pedigree reaches back to the International Style and the Bauhaus, but has been relaxed by postmodernism and inspired by recent advances in building materials, techniques and systems. Nothing helps the new Alpine architecture like the grandeur of the old Alpine landscape, but this show confirms the point so often lost on American builders: that elegance, sustainability, innovation and respect for the environment are not antithetical. It also confirms that the only good scale is human scale and that new land should be used reluctantly and carefully, like the precious and finite commodity it is. A show within a show of 40 houses by the same architects reflects more intimate applications of their ideas. One can come away with the inspiring realization that old history can be taught new tricks, and that even in these global, postmodern, pluralistic times, there can still be such a thing as a coherent style that accommodates individual sensibilities. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free.  SMITH    KATHERINE BOWLING, ''Divide,'' Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, through tomorrow. To plain vanilla countryside, Ms. Bowling's softly brushed works bring a touch of soul. Concentrating on the landscapes surrounding her home in upstate New York, she responds to the roads, trees and fields that she experiences daily and the light that falls on them at various times of day and night. Her spirit is derived from the great landscapists of the past, but she uses thoroughly modern compositional and painting devices.  GLUECK    FRITZ BULTMAN, ''Irascible II: Abstract Expressionist Paintings, Circa 1960,'' Schlesinger, 24 East 73rd Street, (212) 734-3600, through tomorrow. In the late 1950's and early 60's, this Abstract Expressionist was in top form, judging by the eight small- to medium-size canvases in this show. He wasn't doing anything that Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline didn't do, but his impetuous, sensuously crusty paintings have an urgency of their own that still feels fresh.  JOHNSON    TONY DE LOS REYES, ''The Strange Tale of Near and Far,'' DCKT Contemporary, 537 West 24th Street, SoHo, (212) 741-9955, through tomorrow. From a distance it looks as if Mr. de los Reyes is in engaged in an eccentric revival of some antique tradition. He paints images of 17th-century ships at sea and detailed images of wild plants and flowers in shades of blue and white like Delftware. Up close you discover that these glossy pictures are made by distinctively modern methods of pouring, pooling and manipulating liquid paint.  JOHNSON    NICOLA HICKS, Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue, between 77th and 78th Street, (212) 439-1700, through tomorrow. This accomplished British sculptor combines neo-Classical traditionalism, surrealistic mythology and Modernist raw materialism in bronze and painted plaster representations of humans and animals. The life-size reclining nude attended by winged putti veers toward old school academicism, but the portraits of dogs and the muscular head of a Minotaur have much vitality.  JOHNSON    WILLIAM HUDDERS, Tatistcheff, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-4547, through tomorrow. If you gave this exhibition of neatly painted views of Long Island City-scapes and still-life pictures of shoes, apples and glassware just a quick glance you might peg it as the work of an earnestly conservative recent art school graduate. The more you look, however, the more inexplicably odd, sweet and subtly humorous these cannily simplified pictures seem. Influences of De Chirico and Hopper are evident, but Mr. Hudders has his own engaging way with the poetry of ordinary things.  JOHNSON    * NALINI MALANI, Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 989-7074, through tomorrow. Ms. Malani, based in Mumbai, has been seen here only sporadically, with paintings in museum group shows and an intensely theatrical video installation at the New Museum two years ago. Both media play a role in this strong gallery solo show, her first in Manhattan, that draws on mythology, religion and history, both Western and Indian. particularly as they shape the lives of women. In paintings, she dovetails the figures of Sita from the ''Ramayana'' and Medea -- the one an ideal of submissive self-sacrifice, the other an emblem of destructive fury -- to propose a complex female persona beyond controlling stereotypes. A video installation addressing sectarian violence and a magic lantern-style shadow play complete the exhibition, which finds a political artist of impressive visual range at the height of her power.  COTTER    STONE ROBERTS, Salander-O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606, through tomorrow. Mr. Roberts aims for a kind of Victorian revivalism in his big paintings of well-to-do New Yorkers inside and outside their well-appointed homes. Apparently copied from photographs, they are made with assiduous attention to detail, and from a distance the realist illusionism is impressive if not colorful. The narrative psychology is vapid, however, and under close-up inspection, the paint is lifeless.

Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights. Full reviews of current shows, additional listings, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/theater.    Broadway    + 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories, from traffic cones into megaphones to garbage bags into evening gowns. But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed Off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $95.  BEN BRANTLEY    + 'DRACULA, THE MUSICAL' And here it is, looming like a giant stuffed bat on a stick, the easiest target on Broadway. This show, which sets the familiar tale of old snaggletooth to the familiar music of Frank Wildhorn, bristles with all the animation, suspense and sex appeal of a Victorian waxworks in a seaside amusement park. Take your shots. Say something, if you must, about toothlessness or bloodlessness or the kindness of hammering stakes into the hearts of undead shows. But you may concede that it isn't much fun to trash something so eminently trashable. ''Dracula, the Musical,'' which features a book and lyrics by Don Black and Christopher Hampton and is directed by Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''), isn't simply bad, which is an aesthetic state of being that is kind of fun if you're in the right mood. It is bad and boring. Among the talents wasted here are Melissa Errico, Kelli O'Hara, Stephen McKinley Henderson and, looking like a butler's butler in the title role, Tom Hewitt (2:10). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6000. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $101.25.  BRANTLEY    + 'LAUGH WHORE' For indisputable evidence that comedy is fueled by anger, take a gander at Mario Cantone's face as he approaches a payoff line in ''Laugh Whore,'' his gussied-up standup-comedy show. The dancing eyebrows flatline. The jaw settles into a strained grimace. The soft brown eyes are transformed into bottomless pools of hostility. Mr. Cantone is in fact most appealing, and most hilarious, when he's seething his way through a tale of irritation, the voice spiraling suddenly from a friendly hum to a train whistle. Probably best known as one of the gay accessories sported by the ''Sex and the City'' gals to match their Manolos, Mr. Cantone is himself gay. Much of the funniest material in ''Laugh Whore'' is an expression of a buoyantly, exuberantly, even belligerently gay sensibility. But the best jokes can bulldoze their way across cultural barriers, and even the metrosexually challenged will appreciate much of Mr. Cantone's material. The director Joe Mantello oversees this production, but much of it retains the formless feeling of a club routine. Structure and thematic design, not necessities in an hourlong club set, are more important for a two-hour, two-act Broadway engagement, and they are missing in action here. But if ''Laugh Whore'' may not prove to be the shapeliest of the many solo shows heading to a Broadway theater near you this fall, it is certainly a fine first salvo (2:15). Cort, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $80.  CHARLES ISHERWOOD    * 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988, directed by Mark Brokaw. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic housewife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end, you may feel like you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51-$79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show.  BRANTLEY    * 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production, directed with brisk straightforwardness by Scott Ellis. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, all of whom manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. 7 p.m. curtain from Nov. 9 through Nov. 18. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.  BRANTLEY    * 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure on stage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naïf of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly as ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Hirschfeld, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101.  BRANTLEY    Off Broadway    *+ ''BUG.'' Have you ever been to a play that made you itch all over? Paranoia festers in the skin, as provokingly physical as a poison-ivy rash, in Tracy Letts's lurid story of a man, a woman and a whole lot of really tiny critters. Scratching is the least of what its characters do to try to ease their discomfort. The visceral wallop of ''Bug'' is likely to come as a shock -- even to fans of Mr. Letts's ''Killer Joe.'' ''Bug'' also inspires laughs, but of a much more uneasy variety. Directed with expert and sadistic timing by Dexter Bullard, this production ultimately drags you by force into the fear and squalor onstage, making this the theater season's wildest ride (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $55; $60 for the evening shows on Fridays and Saturdays.  BRANTLEY    *+ 'GUANTÁNAMO: ''HONOR BOUND TO DEFEND FREEDOM'' ' On an anxious night, you have probably had a dream that goes something like this: You are arrested by uniformed officers for a crime that is never specified but that you know you did not commit, and there is no way for you to prove your innocence. Such a scenario was immortalized by Franz Kafka in ''The Trial.'' It is also the real-life situation of Jamal al-Harith, Bisher al-Rawi, Mozzam Begg and Ruel Ahmed. Their stories are told with a bafflement that shades into gut-level despair in this deeply moving documentary play by Victoria Brittain and Gillian Slovo. First produced in London by the Tricycle Theater, this calmly condemning drama considers the plights of some of the British detainees in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. There is no question that it is a partisan work, but it exerts an icy visceral charge that is never achieved by flashier agitprop satire (1:45). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street Theater, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesday, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $60.  BRANTLEY    'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.  ISHERWOOD    + 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns chosen by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90.  LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    'TRYING' The indignities of aging assume aspects both touching and comic in ''Trying,'' a slight and sentimental new play by Joanna McClelland Glass that is given a measure of ballast by a gracious, subtly turned performance from Fritz Weaver. Mr. Weaver plays Francis Biddle, a lawyer whose distinguished career included stints as the United States attorney general under Franklin D. Roosevelt and as a judge at the Nuremberg trials, in Ms. Glass's stage memoir about her youthful days as Biddle's secretary. Ms. Glass's stand-in, Sarah Schorr (Kati Brazda), is a young wife fresh from academe, and new to Washington, when she begins working for Biddle, here depicted as a frosty curmudgeon whose pride in his achievements and his patrician heritage is continually affronted by the unmistakable signs of his declining physical and intellectual powers. Mr. Weaver gives a wonderfully conscientious performance, imbuing his character with a moving sense of aggrieved dignity that tempers the writing's occasional tendencies to reduce him to a cutely exasperating old fogey. But the scope of Mr. Weaver's performance is limited by the writing. Ms. Glass neatly establishes her characters' contrasting backgrounds and conflicting personalities, but she doesn't supply them with much to do (2:15). Promenade, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $66.25.  ISHERWOOD    + 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudités. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses and the inimitable Julie Halston, who finds the wildly surreal in the conventional role of a blue-blooded snob (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.  BRANTLEY    Last Chance    + 'DIRTY TRICKS' Distinguishing between blazing energy and plain old desperation isn't always easy. Look at Martha Mitchell, who as the wife of United States Attorney General John Mitchell teetered so spectacularly between high spirits and dementia during the Watergate era. Now in John Jeter's ''Dirty Tricks,'' the redoubtable Judith Ivey has taken on the woman whose eagerness to share secrets and fears with the American people helped bring down the presidency of Richard Nixon. Ms. Ivey, as always, has vitality and skill to spare. But these assets are deployed in a vain attempt to paper over the seams in a conspicuously piecemeal play. Like its compulsively chatty heroine, ''Dirty Tricks,'' directed by Margaret Whitton, is scattershot, hazy and, yes, desperate. Even with Ms. Ivey pouring on the cotillion-belle flirtiness and Southern discomfort, ''Dirty Tricks'' is nowhere near as entertaining or alarming as Mrs. Mitchell was at the height of her notoriety (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50.  BRANTLEY    * 'MRS. FARNSWORTH' Political candidates poised to sling mud might take a pointer from A. R. Gurney: good manners can be lethal weapons. Though it deals with revelations that are the stuff of smear campaigns, ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' is as polite and sweetly subversive a political attack as you're likely to come across. Set in a creative-writing classroom (with the excellent Danny Burstein as the teacher), the play unfolds around its title character's desire to write a novel about her youthful involvement with a man who sounds awfully like George W. Bush. Sigourney Weaver, returning to the role she created last spring, deploys annihilating charm as a wealthy high-WASP wife; Gerry Bamman, as her husband, completes the cast. ''Mrs. Farnsworth,'' directed by Jim Simpson, is a polemical exercise that never screams at you. Instead, it feels as if it is spoken out of the side of the mouth -- sotto voce and through a locked jaw. As delivered by Ms. Weaver, this turns out be a thoroughly disarming technique (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. Tonight at 7; tomorrow at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $60.  BRANTLEY    Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    Now Playing    'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her long-time director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair -- from rapture to heartbreak to revenge -- the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core, and Mr. Evans has all the sexual magnetism of a boiled potato. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Bening gallantly, and she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will.  A. O. SCOTT    'BIRTH' Starring Nicole Kidman. Directed by Jonathan Glazer (R, 100 minutes). A metaphysical puzzle -- part ghost story, part melodrama -- in which Ms. Kidman plays Anna, a wealthy Manhattan widow, who meets a young boy claiming to be her dead husband. The premise is strange, almost preposterous, but Mr. Glazer presents it with a hushed, solemn intensity that keeps you in a state of pleasurable disorientation. The screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière wrote many scripts for Luis Buñuel, and there is an element of arch surrealism in this tale, which might be cold and mechanical were it not for Ms. Kidman's performance. As the mood shifts ingeniously from gothic to romance to comedy of manners, her emotions play in counterpoint, flickering from light-heartedness to uncertainty to full-eyed sorrow. ''Birth'' doesn't just ask you to suspend disbelief, but to let go of reason, an invitation that is worth accepting if you can.  SCOTT    'ENDURING LOVE' Starring Daniel Craig, Rhys Ifans and Samantha Morton. Directed by Roger Michell (R, 100 minutes). In the new British film ''Enduring Love,'' Mr. Ifans plays the part of the scorned lover with neurasthenic delicacy and a spidery creepiness. Lanky and loose-limbed, Mr. Ifans has fine flaxen hair that occasionally brushes into his eyes, a bit of peek-a-boo that in the role of Jed Parry, scorned lover and full-bore psychopath, the actor transforms into a gesture of unsettling coquetry. Jed loves Joe (Mr. Craig), who in turn loves Claire (Ms. Morton), who in the way of the world and tragic romances, mostly seems to love herself. Theirs is a roundelay of misunderstanding and bruising, modern disconnection. Based on the novel by the English writer Ian McEwan and directed by Mr. Michell, an Englishman who's probably best known for the grating romantic comedy ''Notting Hill'' and should be known more for the pulp thriller ''Changing Lanes,'' ''Enduring Love'' is a serious movie about love, principally its petty cruelties and monstrous disguises. Soft, tender love, the kind that wraps you in comfort and warmth, much less the kind that sends you over the moon, is almost nonexistent in this curious, lachrymose story.  MANOHLA DARGIS    'IT'S ALL ABOUT LOVE' Starring Joaquin Phoenix and Claire Danes. Directed by Thomas Vinterberg (R, 104 minutes). In some movies there comes a moment of truth when the flickering images either scatter apart irreparably or bind together like a dream. Perched at the edge of coherence or maybe just our personal orthodoxies, these films can be undone by a clumsy line reading or the most minor hitch in logic. Such is the case with the quasi-futuristic ''It's All About Love,'' the most recent feature from the Danish director Thomas Vinterberg. Things are a bit dodgy right from the start when Mr. Phoenix, as John, explains in voiceover that he's on his way to obtain a divorce from his wife, Elena (Ms. Danes), an internationally renowned ice skater. (Unless men are clubbing one another with hockey sticks, ice skating rarely bodes well for movies; regrettably, the same often holds true of the adult Ms. Danes.) Soon afterward two of Elena's bodyguards take John to meet her at a sepulchral hotel that's supposed to be in New York, but looks like it was built from the ground up on a Danish soundstage. As it happens, the hotel and much of the rest of film were manufactured in a movie studio, albeit in Sweden.  DARGIS    'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' Starring Billy Bob Thornton. Directed by Peter Berg (PG-13, 105 minutes). Mr. Berg directs this Texas high school football extravaganza in a tough, gritty style that gives it an unusually fine and vivid sense of place. The place in question is Odessa, a West Texas town where football is more than just an obsession; it's the foundation of the social order and the source of life's meaning. The film, based on H. G. Bissinger's 1990 book of reportage, follows a handful of senior athletes and their put-upon coach (Mr. Thornton) through an anxious season. The town wants a state championship, and in trying to satisfy this expectation the young men face extraordinary risks and sacrifices. Conventional as it is, ''Friday Night Lights'' is both rousing and honest, and it features good performances from Derek Luke, as the team's star runner, and Lucas Black as its anxious quarterback.  SCOTT    'THE GRUDGE' Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr. Directed by Takashi Shimizu (PG-13, 110 minutes). The haunted house in ''The Grudge'' isn't draped with cobwebs, but every so often, it issues an unsettling creak that sounds like the shifting of delicate old bones. Located in Tokyo up a long driveway where dead leaves skitter like mice, the house has been home to so many victims that it has taken five movies to chronicle their unfortunate demise. All the films in the series were directed by Mr. Shimizu, who also wrote all but this one; the first four, rather bewilderingly, carry some variation on the Japanese title ''Ju-On,'' which has to do with the notion of vengeance. The film nominally pivots on Ms. Gellar, from television's ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' as Karen, an American social-work student living in Tokyo. Along with her boyfriend, Doug (Mr. Behr), an American architecture student who reads books titled, yes, ''Japanese Architecture,'' Karen is making a go in a strange new land that only gets stranger when she visits that creaky house on the hill. After another health-care worker goes missing, Karen has to walk up that hill to care for a catatonic older woman, Emma (the spooky Grace Zabriskie), who seems to have been left home alone. Creak goes the house as something that sounds like a cat goes meo-o-o-ow.  DARGIS    * 'I   HUCKABEES' Starring Dustin Hoffman, Isabelle Huppert, Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman and Lily Tomlin. Directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). This high-wire comedy captures liberal-left despair with astonishingly good humor: it's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for the screwball set. Choc-a-block with strange bedfellows -- Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Tomlin play a hot-and-heavy married couple, Mr. Schwartzman gets his groove on with Ms. Huppert -- the film is a snort-out-loud-funny master class of controlled chaos. In this topsy-turvy world, where yes is the new corporate no and businesses sponsor environmental causes while bulldozing over Ranger Rick, a pair of existential detectives sift through a client's trash to solve the riddle of his malaise. Like Mr. Russell, they gladly risk foolishness to plunge into the muck of human existence. The film is loud, messy, aggressively in your face and generally played for the back row in the theater, and it doesn't offer up solutions, tender any comfort or rejoice in the triumph of the human spirit. All we can do, says Mr. Russell, is keep pushing the rock back uphill. That's kind of a bummer, but in its passion, energy and go-for-broke daring, in its faith in the possibility of human connection (if not its probability), ''I   Huckabees'' provides its own reason for hope.  DARGIS    'LADDER 49' Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta. Directed by Jay Russell (PG-13, 115 minutes). In ''Ladder 49'' fires smolder and rage and generally act in a far more lively and persuasive fashion than any of the men struggling to put them out. A sob story, the film stars Mr. Phoenix as Jack Morrison, a once and future hero who battles untold infernos, saves untold lives and quaffs untold draft beers to become a fireman's fireman, the kind who fearlessly enters burning buildings and puts everything at risk, including a picture-perfect family and a self so radically unexamined, so thin and vaporous, it's a wonder it doesn't drift off the screen along with all the billows of enveloping smoke. Pegged as a true-to-life story, one meant to put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye, this is essentially a male weepy about strong, simple men and the strong, simple women behind them, and as such it's platitudinous rubbish. What makes this nonsense more galling than usual is that while ''Ladder 49'' might have started out as a heartfelt attempt to honor those in the line of literal fire, it weighs in as an attempt to exploit their post-Sept. 11 symbolism.  DARGIS    * 'LIGHTNING IN A BOTTLE' Directed by Antoine Fuqua (PG-13, 104 minutes). The essential ingredients for playing and singing the blues are ''juice and pain,'' says Bonnie Raitt near the end of this remarkable concert documentary. By juice, Ms. Raitt means the raw life force that surges through the music of the blues legends who gathered at Radio City Music Hall on Feb. 26, 2003, for a historic and joyous musical summit. The film weaves performances from that concert with snippets of the musicians rehearsing and swapping stories backstage, and old film clips of legends like Lead Belly, Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker. The 30 performers in the concert (not counting a distinguished house band) include Ms. Raitt, Robert Cray, Solomon Burke and B. B. King. The film is moderately informative, the music intermittently thrilling.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael García Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon.  SCOTT    * 'RAY' Starring Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington and Regina King. Directed by Taylor Hackford (PG-13, 152 minutes). Mr. Hackford's biography of Ray Charles does not entirely avoid the psychologizing, sentimental traps of the genre, but it is nonetheless a potent and invigorating portrait of genius, thanks to Mr. Foxx's performance and to the music of Charles himself. The filmmakers have the good judgment to place the music at the center of the drama, and the movie is full of insights into Charles's innovations and working methods. We witness, in a series of well-executed set pieces, his evolution from a Nat King Cole-style crooner into an R & B innovator, and then into a performer, arranger and composer who seemed able to span the whole range of American vernacular music. Mr. Foxx, whose speech and movement uncannily resemble Charles's, contributes much more than mimicry. You get the sense that he understands his character completely and is able to communicate what he knows without stooping to explanation. The story of musical accomplishment is framed by the usual trials and triumphs of celebrity, but a handful of fine supporting performances -- notably Ms. Washington as Charles's wife, Della Bea, and Ms. King as one of his backup singers -- gives it a feeling of life being lived, rather than just acted out.  SCOTT    'SHALL WE DANCE?' Starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 106 minutes). This Americanization of a popular 1996 Japanese film is an old-fashioned feel-good fantasy that piles on the euphoria. The movie returns Mr. Gere to the site of his hoofing triumph in ''Chicago.'' His character is a mild-mannered estate lawyer, happily married with two teenage children, who on an impulse starts taking evening ballroom dancing classes. As he evolves from bland suburban frog into suave dance-floor prince, he regains his faltering zest for life and refreshes his marriage (to Ms. Sarandon). Ms. Lopez, in full sizzle, is the dedicated instructor who teaches him that ballroom dancing, as she puts it, is ''a vertical expression of a horizontal wish.''  HOLDEN    'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renée Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Where Pixar goes for sublimity and sincerity, DreamWorks continues to prefer a jokey, referential style, full of bright colors, almost-offensive ethnic stereotypes, big-name movie stars and easy cultural references that sail over the heads of the children in the audience and splatter in their parents' faces. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale.  SCOTT    * 'SIDEWAYS' Starring Paul Giamatti. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 124 minutes). The specter of a disappointed life hangs over Mr. Payne's film ''Sideways,'' casting shadows so deep and so dark it's a wonder that the story's nearly broken hero hasn't drowned in them. But Miles, beautifully played by Mr. Giamatti, hasn't yet been broken by his divorce, unpublished novels and the accumulation of everyday indignities that have helped make him the man he is. And therein lies the great cosmic joke of this heart-piercing film: without struggle and pain, Miles wouldn't be half the good and decent man he is, though he certainly might complain a little less, venture a little more. Directed by Mr. Payne, who adapted the screenplay with his long-time writing partner, Jim Taylor, from the book by Rex Pickett, ''Sideways'' is about a man on the verge of saying uncle to life. The film opens with Miles taking off with his longtime friend Jack (Thomas Haden Church) to the central California coast for an orchestrated week of wine, golf and camaraderie. Afterward, the two will motor back to reality where Jack, a B-list actor and pretty boy fast on the fade, will marry for the first time. For Miles, eagerly waiting word on the fate of yet another manuscript, the week promises a much-needed respite from his day-to-day; for Jack it's an excuse to beat a quick if temporary retreat from the future.  DARGIS    'STAGE BEAUTY' Starring Billy Crudup and Claire Danes. Directed by Richard Eyre (R, 105 minutes). A 17th-century ''Star Is Born,'' though with interestingly convoluted sexual politics and a provocative historical thesis. Mr. Crudup is Ned Kynaston, one of the biggest stars of the London stage, who specializes in playing Shakespearean heroines. Ms. Danes is Maria, his loyal, ambitious dresser, who, with the help of the king's mistress, ends the long ban on female performers, thus destroying Ned's career. In spite of a sludgy Sunday-brunch score and a weak performance from Ms. Danes, the film explores its period with rare precision and with a lively sense of intellectual curiosity. Much of this is squandered, though, in a flat and conventional final act that turns Ned and Maria into the inventors of Method acting and, recoiling from its earlier subtlety, celebrates a world where men are men and women are women.  SCOTT    * 'TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE' With the voices of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Directed by Mr. Parker (R, 98 minutes). Without question the finest R-rated puppet action-musical of the past decade. Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone, the creators of ''South Park,'' apply their foulmouthed ingenuity to blow-'em-up cinema and current geopolitics. Saddam Hussein, a key character in the ''South Park'' movie, has been replaced by Kim Jong Il, a bespectacled blend of Eric Cartman and Professor Chaos, who plots to arm terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. If that doesn't sound like a laughing matter, fear not: there are plenty of profane, catchy songs and giddily offensive jokes to keep you amused. But like any good satire, this film has a distinct moral point of view. The members of Team America, the square-jawed action heroes who take on Kim and his supporting cast of left-wing Hollywood stooges, may blow up a lot of stuff, but they do it by accident, not by design. And while the movie is happy to mock American bluster, it also expresses a blunt, uncynical patriotism.  SCOTT    * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade.  DARGIS    Rock/Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and pop concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    * AMERICAN MUSIC CLUB, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, and the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The band that introduced Mark Eitzel's brooding and black-humored songs to the world, American Music Club, was always multivalent, able to shift from country to lounge, folk-rock to jazz. It has reconvened after 10 years with a new album, ''Love Songs for Patriots,'' that veers toward politics as well as the psychology of depression. Will Johnson of Centro-Matic opens both shows. At Maxwell's tonight at 10; admission is $10. At the Knitting Factory tomorrow night at 7:30; tickets are $12 in advance, $14 tomorrow.  JON PARELES    * ANIMAL COLLECTIVE, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. The Animal Collective, featuring Avey Tare, Panda Bear, Geologist and Deaken, has been making whimsical, convoluted studio albums full of odd electronic noises and childlike delight. Onstage things get a lot more raucous. Tomorrow night at 9; admission is $12.  PARELES    APOSTLE OF HUSTLE, the Hook, 18 Commerce Street, near Columbia Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, (718) 797-3007. The guitarist Andrew Whiteman, who plays with Broken Social Scene, also leads Apostle of Hustle, a nebulous collective (the word ''band'' doesn't seem quite right) that makes a smoky, elegantly incoherent noise -- dark ballads, lovingly wrapped in bits of noise and woozy rhythms. The first Apostle of Hustle album is ''Folkloric Feel'' (Arts & Crafts), an inviting and sometimes frustrating CD full of songs that don't always reward the attention they seem to require. Tonight at 9:30, with Red Door Exchange and Tony Sherr; tickets are $7.  KELEFA SANNEH    JOAN BAEZ, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, at the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Joan Baez, who was the queen of the Greenwich Village folkies in the 1960's, continues to seek out material from the generations of singers and songwriters she influenced, bringing them an almost maternal concern. Tomorrow and Saturday night at 9; tickets are $35.  PARELES    DEVENDRA BANHART, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, at the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. Devendra Banhart's eerie, wavery voice and stream-of-consciousness songs reach back to the childlike surrealism of some of psychedelia's most beloved oddballs: Syd Barrett and the pre-glam-rock Marc Bolan. Sunday night at 9, with Six Organs of Admittance opening; tickets are $15.  PARELES    * BUCK 65, Southpaw, 125 Fifth Avenue, at Sterling Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0236. A rapper from a small town in Canada, Buck 65 rhymes in a scratchy Tom Waits voice not just about his skills, but about the boondocks, some lowlife film-noir escapades and his respect for his father. Between tracks, he scratches discs and does a hilarious Mick Jagger imitation. The Soledad Brothers are throwback 1960's-style garage-rockers who don't stint on the fuzztone. Tonight at 8, with Dirty Excuse opening; admission is $10.  PARELES    AMY CORREIA, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Amy Correia's quavery, off-center voice isn't as fragile as it sounds. On her new album, ''Lakeville'' (Nettwerk), the characters in her songs are often barely hanging on, but there's a clarity in her details and bluesy streak in her voice that means they'll hang on tightly. Tonight at 7; tickets are $12.  PARELES    DRAIOCHT, Glucksman Ireland House, 1 Washington Mews (Fifth Avenue above Washington Square), (212) 998-3950. Two all-Ireland champions -- the flutist June McCormack and the Celtic harpist and concertina player Michael Rooney -- are allied in the duo called Draiocht, which means magic. They'll play traditional songs and new traditionalist tunes. Tonight at 9; admission is $15.  PARELES    EL VEZ, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Most Elvis imitators are corny; El Vez is conceptual, merging Presleyana, Mexican-American in-jokes and bad puns to simultaneously honor and twist the Presley legacy. This is his ''El Vez for Prez'' show. Tonight at 10, with Groovie Ghoulies opening; admission is $15.  PARELES    * EVERCLEAR, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. ''People love to tell you things that will break your heart,'' sings Art Alexakis of Everclear. He's one of the rare rock songwriters to sing about adult life, from disillusionment to divorce to a ''Volvo Driving Soccer Mom,'' while his tunes revel in the blare of pop-punk and grunge. Tonight, at 8, with Avion opening; tickets are $26.  PARELES    * FUTUREHEADS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703, Reaching back to the lean post-punk of Talking Heads, Gang of Four and the early Cure -- not to mention a touch of the Beatles, the Futureheads, from northern England, write about the joys and travails of young adulthood -- a new city, a new job -- in terse little songs that pack a lot into three minutes. Tomorrow night at 10; admission is $10.  PARELES    GHOSTLY INTERNATIONAL, Rothko, 116 Suffolk Street, at Riving Street, Lower East Side, www.rothkonyc.com. A night of D.J.'s and producers affiliated with the Ann Arbor-based electronica label Ghostly International, starring Kill Memory Crash, a duo that toys with the sound and spirit of 1980's industrial music. Also on the bill: Matthew Dear (who is to perform as Audion, his raucous, buzz- and blip-happy alter ego), Tadd Mullinix (who is to play a dark techno set as James T. Cotton), and the D.J.'s Mike Servito, Derek Plaslaiko and Todd Osbourne. Tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $9.  SANNEH    LAIBACH, Downtime, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747. Laibach, a band from Slovenia, traffics in songs with bass vocals and a jackbooted beat. The band's imagery is totalitarian or fascist; the attitude is deliberately enigmatic, refusing to telegraph whether Laibach is joking. Tomorrow night at 9, with Bonfire Madigan opening; admission is $20 in advance, $25 at the door.  PARELES    EUGENIA LEON/MARTA GOMEZ, S.O.B.'s (Sounds of Brazil), 204 Varick Street, at Houston, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Eugenia Leon, from Mexico, pours drama into love songs, whether she's singing in spare cabaret arrangements or full-scale pop. She shares the bill with Marta Gomez, who merges Colombian traditions with the delicacy of cabaret. Sunday night at 8; admission is $15.  PARELES    * MAGIK MARKERS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. This vicious but oblique Louisville free-rock trio plays a concert organized by the record label Ecstatic Peace. Also on the bill: Mouthus, the Notekillers and the trio of Maryanne Amacher, Jim O'Rourke and Thurston Moore. Sunday night at 8; tickets are $10.  SANNEH    THE MIGHTY SPARROW/BYRON LEE AND THE DRAGONAIRES, Riverside Church, South Hall, 91 Claremont Avenue below 122d Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 870-6784. This benefit concert for hurricane relief in the Caribbean brings together pioneers of Caribbean music. The Mighty Sparrow, from Trinidad, revolutionized calypso after World War II, sharpening its tunes, its political impact and its humor. Byron Lee and the Dragonaires, formed in 1957, helped introduce ska to the world beyond Jamaica and became a Jamaican music mogul while continuing to lead the band and becoming a prime mover in creating a Jamaican carnival in the 1990's. Tonight at 8; tickets are $35 and $100.  PARELES    * THURSTON MOORE/THE NOTEKILLERS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. An influence comes home to roost. The guitarist Thurston Moore got some ideas for Sonic Youth from the frenetic minimalist punk instrumentals of a Philadelphia band called the Notekillers, whose recording career lasted from 1977 to 1981. The band's guitarist and composer, David First, has continued to explore music full of drones and overtones, though much of it is more serene than the Notekillers were. Now that Mr. Moore's label, Ecstatic Peace, has released ''Notekillers (1977-1981),'' the group has reunited. Sunday night at 8, with Magik Markers and Mouthus opening; admission is $10.  PARELES    * ONEIDA, Sin-e, 148 Attorney Street, below Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 388-0077. Oneida, from New York, wants to put teeth back into minimalistic rock. It revs up frantic, obsessive patterns to carry thoughts about sex, drugs, rock 'n' roll and a dystopian future. Tonight at 8, with Devil Woman, Parts and Labor and Pterodactyl opening; admission is $8.  PARELES    * ISAIAH OWENS, Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177. Gospel meets blues at the level of raw passion in the songs of Isaiah Owens, a 69-year-old singer and guitarist who sang lead for 45 years with the Flying Clouds gospel quartet of Montgomery, Ala. On his own, he plucks a distorted guitar and sings in a voice that rasps like a preacher and leaps into a serrated falsetto, letting loose gospel fervor as an exalted frenzy. Tonight and Sunday night at 7:30; admission is $5.  PARELES    TOSHI REAGON AND BIG LOVELY, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 539-8778 or (212) 239-6200. Singing about both love and politics with the same sense of independence, Toshi Reagon applies her gutsy voice and syncopated guitar playing to songs steeped in blues and funk. Tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9:30; tickets are $20.  PARELES    THE SLIP, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503 and Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. From the jazzy side of the jam-band spectrum, the Slip is a guitar-bass-drums trio that sidles into odd meters, elliptical guitar tunes akin to Pat Metheny, funk grooves or quasi-African group drumming. At Tonic tonight at 9; admission is $16. At the Mercury Lounge tomorrow night, starting two sets at 10 p.m., with Court and Spark opening at 8:30; tickets are $14 in advance, $16 tomorrow.  PARELES    * AMY RIGBY, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 576-1155. After years in various New York country-rock groups, Amy Rigby emerged on her own. She has made six worthy albums of succinct, tuneful songs about struggling through adulthood, when jobs, romance and motherhood aren't exactly what she'd hoped for. Tomorrow night at 7:30; admission is $15.  PARELES    * SOLEX, Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103. This playful Amsterdam-based singer and producer sings whimsical (and sometimes lovely) songs atop meticulously assembled sound collages. Her new album is ''The Laughing Stock of Indie Rock'' (Arena Rock). Sunday night at 9, with the Advantage, Narchitect and Victoria Lucas; tickets are $8 in advance, $10 at the door.  SANNEH    * ANDY STATMAN, Skirball Center, 566 LaGuardia Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 545-7536. Andy Statman goes deep into old styles to renew them. As a klezmer clarinetist who was a major force in the klezmer revival, he studied with elders who were close the music's Eastern European and Balkan roots, but recently he has been exploring klezmer as an ecstatic music, hearing cantorial echoes in John Coltrane. And as a mandolin player, he delves into bluegrass but also makes jazz connections. This concert will feature both parts of his repertory. Tomorrow night at 8:30; tickets are $30, $26 for World Music Institute members.  PARELES    A TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE PALMIERI, Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212)  721-6500. Charlie Palmieri, who died in 1988, was a hardworking Latin pianist and bandleader for four decades. He studied piano at Juilliard and went on to start, and to weather, Latin dance trends from Cuban-style charanga to New York bugalu. He also sparked the development of Latin jazz with a hugely influential series of early-1960's studio jam sessions, or descargas. This tribute concert brings together a 25-piece orchestra conducted by Ray Santos along with the pianist Eddie Palmieri (Charlie's brother), the trombonist Jimmy Bosch, the violinist Alfredo de la Fé, the saxophonist Mario Rivera, the percussionist Giovanni Hidalgo and other leading Latin musicians to make his repertory dance again. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25 to $75.  PARELES    JIMMY VAN M., JUNKIE XL, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000. A dance party featuring Jimmy Van M, a progressive-house D.J. known for laying blurry, slightly melancholy sounds and melodies over his muscular, sometimes mechanical beats. He is to be joined by Junkie XL, the Dutch D.J. and producer who had a hit with his 2002 remix of Elvis Presley's ''Little Less Conversation.'' As that single suggested, his style is eclectic but straightforward: he can turn an unlikely idea into a good-natured romp. Tonight after 10; tickets are $15 in advance, $25 at the door.  SANNEH    THE WAIFS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The Waifs are a young, frisky Australian band in love with older American music like folk-rock and the blues, singing about trains and city life and huffing up a storm on harmonica. Tomorrow night at 8, with Erin McKeown opening; tickets are $16.50.  PARELES    * KANYE WEST, Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-4882. This irresistible rapper-producer is the headliner at a benefit concert for an anti-homelessness group. He's got perhaps the best punchlines in the business (''She's so precious/With the peer pressures/Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter A-lexus''), and his debut CD, ''The College Dropout'' (Roc-A-Fella/Island Def Jam), is one of 2004's best albums. He is to be joined by Common, an exhilarating performer whose rambling, unpredictable rhymes evoke idealism and resentment in equal measure. Also scheduled to appear: the neo-soul crooner Musiq and the turntablism crew the X-Ecutioners. Tonight at 8; tickets are $35 and $37.50.  SANNEH    WHIRLING DERVISHES OF DAMASCUS, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800 or (212) 545-7536. With their tall caps pointing skyward and their feet on the ground, dervishes whirl to connect earth and spirit. Their songs are serene, meditative melodies. The accompanying musicians are Sheikh Hamza Shakkur, who officiates at the Great Mosque of Damascus, and the Al-Kindi Ensemble, which plays traditional music from across the Arabic world on oud, qanun (zither), ney (flute) and percussion. Tonight at 8:30; tickets are $30 to $42.  PARELES    * WIZARDS OF INDIAN MUSIC, Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536. Two nights of classical Indian music with improvisers who can be profound and flashy. Tonight's program includes performances by the singers Pandit Jasraj and Bala Murli Krishna, who will also trade North and South Indian-style improvisations in a closing duet, and the flutist Pandit Hari Prasad Chaurasia. Tomorrow night's program includes Pandit Shivkumar Sharma on the santoor, L. Subramaniam on violin, and the dancer Sonal Mansingh; for the finale, Mr. Subramanian and Pandit Jasraj will improvise together. Tonight and tomorrow at 6; tickets are $50, $75 and $100.  PARELES    YELLOWCARD, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Yellowcard's most recent album, ''Ocean Avenue'' (Capitol), has sold over half a million copies, thanks in part to the title track, which follows a simple but appealing neo-punk formula: dry and rhythmic during the verse, wet and tuneful during the chorus. The band's members gleefully rebel against punk rock's tradition of rebellion: in one song, a boy tells his father, ''I want to be the same as you.'' Tonight at 7, with the Starting Line, the Matches and Craig's Brother; tickets are $24.  SANNEH    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.    'BAGS' GROOVE: A TRIBUTE TO MILT JACKSON,' Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. Some members of Milt Jackson's own band join a tribute to the late vibraphonist. Joe Locke plays Mr. Jackson's part; Bob Cranshow will be on bass, Mike LeDonne on piano and Mickey Roker on drums. Sets tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20.  BEN RATLIFF    * DIZZY GILLESPIE FESTIVAL, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 258-9800. The homage to Dizzy Gillespie continues over at New York's latest jazz club, within Jazz at Lincoln Center's new complex; Week Three is devoted to big-band Gillespie, featuring the Juilliard Jazz Orchestra, conducted by Victor Goines, with the trumpeter Tom Harrell and the vocalist Carla Cook as guests. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with sets tonight and tomorrow night at 11; cover charge is $30 and there is a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.  RATLIFF    FREDDIE HUBBARD QUINTET, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. Mr. Hubbard, the trumpeter, has been making sporadic stabs at coming back; though he hasn't yet been fully convincing in recent years, he was, at least, a hard-driving player whose improvisational power remained high throughout the 1980's. Still, he is part of history -- all trumpet students revere him -- and it's good to see him onstage. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 and there is a $10 minimum.  RATLIFF    * 'JAZZ IN MOTION,' Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500. A collaboration between jazz and dance: ''Welcome,'' with music by Wynton Marsalis and choreography by Peter Martins; ''Gauntlet,'' with new music by Joe Chambers and the dancing by Elizabeth Streb's company, Streb; Savion Glover, tap-dancing to new music by Mr. Marsalis; and Garth Fagan's company dancing to pieces of an old collaboration with Mr. Marsalis, ''Griot New York.'' Tonight at 8; tickets are $10 to $150.  RATLIFF    * GREGOIRE MARET GROUP, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. On bandstands run by Jimmy Scott, Cassandra Wilson, Steve Coleman and some others, this Swiss chromatic-harmonica player has been extraordinary, pushing through solos with incantatory power. Don't worry about the novelty of his instrument -- Mr. Maret gives it all the gravity it needs. Sets tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.  RATLIFF    * BILL McHENRY QUARTET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. The 73-year-old drumming master Paul Motian is part of the quartet led by the 32-year-old saxophonist Bill McHenry, and it makes perfect sense. Mr. Motian isn't part of the music's backing: he helped create the aesthetic possibility for it. His drumming is calm and thoughtful, open and unprogrammed; it tries to come up with something new in each bar while retaining a groove. And much of the same spirit can be heard in Mr. McHenry's playing, with the rhythm and harmony of bebop while generally operating in spacey rubato time. Mr. McHenry likes strong, slow melodies; he bends notes with a kind of radical plaintiveness, jumping large intervals in one curving sigh. Sets through Sunday at 9 and 11 p.m., with a 12:30 set tomorrow; cover charge is $30.  RATLIFF    FRANK MORGAN QUARTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Like many other musicians who discovered Charlie Parker when they were just a little too young to be professionals, Mr. Morgan heard bebop as a sacred text. And he still has a remarkably beautiful way with it, presenting it as classical constructions in medium tempo. Set through Sunday at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, $20 on Sunday.  RATLIFF    'ONE FOR TRANE,' Sista's Place, 456 Nostrand Avenue, at Jefferson Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, (718) 398-1766. A tribute to John Coltrane by musicians who worked with him or were influenced by him: the saxophonists Sonny Fortune and Odean Pope; the pianist John Hicks; the bassist Reggie Workman; and the drummer Rashied Ali. Tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; cover charge is $20.  RATLIFF    MATANA ROBERTS QUARTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. A young saxophonist from Chicago who has demonstrated an interest in jazz from Ellington to Ornette Coleman and beyond, to dub and Afrobeat, Ms. Roberts has a growing reputation in New York. She plays with a band including the trumpeter Taylor Ho Bynum, the bassist Tarus Mateen and the drummer Tomas Fujiwara. Sets are tonight at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.  RATLIFF    * 'VISION CLUB': ROB BROWN STONE HOUSE TRIO, MAT MANERI TRIO, Brunstein Showroom, 13 Stanton Street, between Bowery and Chrystie, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681; on the Web, it is visionfestival.org. A new concert series continues, creating different pairings within experimental jazz. The alto saxophonist Rob Brown improvises clearly, with a bright tone, and a lot of imagination; Mat Maneri, the violinist, creates an environment of wicked calm and unpredictability. Both are among the better bandleaders in the New York free-jazz scene. Tomorrow at 8 (Mr. Brown); at 10 (Mr. Maneri); admission is $15.  RATLIFF    BEN WALTZER GROUP, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319. A no-nonsense young jazz pianist in the Ellington and Monk vein, Mr. Waltzer gets a big, ringing sound out of the extreme registers of the instrument; his recent album, ''100 Dreams Ago'' (Fresh Sound), shows a focused bandleader. Music starts tonight at 8:30; cover charge is $10.  RATLIFF    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.  STEPHEN HOLDEN    MELISSA MANCHESTER, Feinstein's at the Regency, Regency Hotel, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. The one-time reigning diva of Arista Records has adopted a back-to-basics approach to her music, toning down her brassiness to reach back to her early days as a smoky voiced singer-songwriter. Old hits like ''Come In From the Rain'' and ''Don't Cry Out Loud'' are revisited in a quieter mode. Her voice, unfortunately, is considerably the worse for wear. And new songs that aspire to take a longer, deeper view of life and love are marred by lyrics that reduce honest sentiments to greeting-card banalities. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $60; $40 minimum at the early shows, $30 for the late shows.  HOLDEN    BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $95.  HOLDEN    * PAULA WEST AND THE ERIC REED TRIO, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. This San Francisco jazz singer has always relished transgressing stylistic conventions. Her new show includes a folk-jazz-rap version of Bob Dylan's ''Subterranean Homesick Blues,'' which she turns into a slurred mouthful of pure jazz rhythm. Her mischievous streak also asserts itself in slyly updated versions of Cole Porter's ''At Long Last Love'' and ''Anything Goes,'' that mention phenomena like nonfat creamer, the Hilton sisters and reality television. Her thoughtful renditions of ''Stormy Weather'' and ''Black and Blue'' find her emerging as a heavyweight balladeer. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11:30. Cover: $50; $40 prix fixe dinner at the early shows, $20 minimum at the late shows.  HOLDEN    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances:  nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'AIDA' The Metropolitan Opera often succeeds in making a spectacle of itself; at least the spectacle is warranted in Verdi's ''Aida,'' which was originally conceived as grand opera. Everyone involved in the current revival can more or less make the thing fly, led by Dolora Zajick as an Amneris whose ringing mezzo threatens to blow everyone else offstage, the excellent Marcello Viotti in the pit, and, when he's on, Eduardo Villa as a ringing Radamès. Anooshah Golesorkhi is a valiant Amonasro, but isn't really a Verdi baritone, and the role of Aida is a couple of sizes too large for Fiorenza Cedolins. Still, add a few armies of dancers and horses and you could have a fine old time. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $145 to $215.  ANNE MIDGETTE    'LA BOHÈME' Ruth Anne Swenson is the fresh face in the cast of this Puccini favorite, which has returned to the Met in Franco Zeffirelli's outsize production. Ms. Swenson is well-known to opera fans for her beautifully nimble coloratura soprano, but she has recently been exploring more dramatic spinto roles, singing her first ever Mimi at the Met last month. She held her own at that performance, though she sounded underpowered next to the booming tenor of Marcelo Álvarez. Elsewhere in the cast, Peter Mattei sings an impressive Marcello, with rich, deep colors in his baritone. Daniel Oren conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200.  JEREMY EICHLER    'CAVALLERIA RUSTICANA' AND 'PAGLIACCI' Opera's favorite double bill returns tomorrow night in the Metropolitan Opera's venerable productions of Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci.'' Go not for a famous cast but for Mascagni's lightning-bolt blood and guts and Leoncavallo's equally sinister exercise in revenge and murder. Dennis Russell Davies conducts both operas. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215.  BERNARD HOLLAND    'HAROUN AND THE SEA OF STORIES' The New York City Opera, already having one of its best seasons in years, is presenting the world premiere of a major opera by Charles Wuorinen, the unabashedly rigorous American modernist composer. Give Mr. Wuorinen credit for sensing the operatic possibilities of Salman Rushdie's enchanting and timely 1990 novel for children. The story, a parable about the importance of the imagination, tells of a young boy, Haroun, the son of a famed story-teller who has lost his gift of gab, and Haroun's daring adventure to the Sea of Stories, where the boy defeats the Prince of Silence and reconnects his father's mental pipeline to the sources of imagination in the magical sea. James Fenton has streamlined and adapted the novel into one of the best librettos in some time. Mark Lamos's colorful and playful production works beautifully. But Mr. Wuorinen's formidable score, though it has brilliant strokes, overwhelms the drama and the challenging vocal lines with unremittingly complex undercurrents of skittish atonal orchestral music. The soprano Heather Buck brings tomboyish energy and a bright, agile voice to the title role. George Manahan draws a confident and vibrant performance from the cast and orchestra. Tomorrow at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $115.  ANTHONY TOMMASINI    'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' Though the New York City Opera may garner the most attention for its adventurous productions of operas from the 20th century and the Baroque era, the company can also do extremely well by the standard repertory, as with its current revival of Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro.'' The 1977 production, with period sets and costumes, is still pleasant and effective. What counts, though, is the cast and this one is delightful. The Israeli soprano Sharon Rostorf-Zamir, in her company debut, makes a sweet-toned, lyrical and endearingly plucky Susanna. The strapping and robust-voiced bass-baritone David Pittsinger towers over her as Figaro, and sparks fly between them. Jennifer Rivera brings her dusky mezzo-soprano voice and impish stage presence to the role of the hormonal page Cherubino. Paulo Szot and Orla Boylan as the Count and Countess Almaviva are also standouts. And Steven Mosteller conducts a lithe and articulate performance. I was not prepared for this revival to be so good. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $115.  TOMMASINI    'LA TRAVIATA' Verdi's drama is so well written that a singer who can manage to get through the difficult title role is virtually guaranteed a success. At City Opera, Maria Kanyova attacks Violetta with a will and negotiates the role's hurdles with a kind of fierce vivacity, down to a brief but solid high E-flat at the end of ''Sempre libera'' in Act I. Since the start of this revival in September, she's been joined by some new men in her life: Grant Youngblood, who should be a fine strong Germont, and Eric Fennell as Alfredo. Atsushi Yamada conducts these two final performances of the run. Tonight at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 1:30, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105 tonight, $32 to $105 on Sunday.  MIDGETTE    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC The concerts on the barge tomorrow night and Sunday are intriguing, less for the repertory per se (Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev and Miaskovsky) than for the ensemble: the Kopelman Quartet in its New York debut. The group's leader, the Ukrainian violinist Mikhail Kopelman, left the Tokyo String Quartet in 2002 after mutual recognition that his own distinctly Slavic approach diverged too greatly from that of his Japanese and British colleagues. Reversing course, Mr. Kopelman has now assembled a quartet of players with identical backgrounds, having all trained together at the Moscow Conservatory in the 1970's. The homogeneity promises better chemistry, and, at a time when the personnel of many ensembles is more diverse than ever, it makes for a fascinating case study in the limits of musical globalization. Rounding out the weekend's programming, the violinist Mark Peskanov and the pianist Katya Mihailova will play Schubert this evening. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $25.  EICHLER    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER David Finckel and Wu Han, the new directors of the Chamber Music Society, speak of curating music rather than programming it; and although they didn't actually program this season, the trio of trios that's on offer on Sunday afternoon has a museumlike aspect, in the best sense. If you want repertory staples in a reliable performance, this is a place to go: three trios by three classical masters (Beethoven, Mendelssohn and Brahms), performed by two ever-reliable artist members of the Society -- Anne-Marie McDermott, the pianist, and Fred Sherry, the cellist -- as well as the violinist Jennifer Frautschi. Sunday at 5 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788. Tickets: $27.50 to $48.  MIDGETTE    ESART TRIO BERLIN Carnegie Hall continues the Distinctive Debuts series and its accompanying exchange program with the European music establishment by presenting the Esart Trio Berlin tonight. Music by the contemporary German composer Wolfgang Rihm should be an item of interest. There is also the more familiar repertory from Beethoven and Dvorak. At 7:30 p.m., Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $24.  HOLLAND    TANIA LEÓN As part of its important Composer Portraits series, Miller Theater is offering an overview of the music of Tania León, in performances by Mosaic, a new-music ensemble, as well as guests (including the composer, who will conduct). Ms. León, who was born in Havana in 1943, writes feisty music that takes Latin, gospel and jazz influences into account but is decidedly in the art music tradition. Among the works to be performed are ''A la Par,''  ''Indígena,''  ''Sin Normas Ajenas,''  ''Canto'' and the New York premiere of ''Azulejos.'' Tonight at 8 (there is a pre-concert discussion at 7), Miller Theater, Columbia University, Broadway at 116th Street, (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $20.  ALLAN KOZINN    PARTHENIA John Dowland's ''Lachrimae,'' a piece with a regretful, descending melodic line meant to suggest the falling of tears, achieved an extraordinary popularity among the melancholy Elizabethans. Having published the work as a song (''Flow My Tears'') and as a virtuosic lute solo, Dowland revisited his hit in 1604, this time using it as the basis for seven pavans, each expressing a different quality of dolefulness. When he published this cycle, as ''Lachrimae, or Seven Tears,'' Dowland added a selection of shorter, brighter dances as well. Parthenia, the surperb viol consort, is joining forces with the lutenist Paul O'Dette to celebrate the 400th anniversary of this collection. Mr. O'Dette is a magnificent Dowland interpreter, and Parthenia's sound (augmented here by John Mark Rozendaal) has the right darkness and heft for the music. Tonight at 8, Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 358-5942. Tickets: $25, $18 for students and 65+.  KOZINN    SUSANNA PHILLIPS The Marilyn Horne Foundation knows how to keep young singers on the map. Susanna Phillips, a soprano from Alabama who holds two degrees from the Juilliard School, was presented in a duo recital by the foundation a couple of years ago and returns on Sunday for her own solo turn, in songs by Schubert, Enescu, Schumann, Poulenc and Walton, accompanied by the pianist Carol Wong. Sunday afternoon at 3, St. Bartholemew's Church, Park Avenue at 51st Street, (212) 378-0248. Tickets: $20, $15 for 65+, free for students.  MIDGETTE    RIVERSIDE SYMPHONY Some orchestras, but not enough of them, have a composer in residence. The Riverside Symphony is actually run by a composer, its artistic director Anthony Korf, along with the conductor George Rothman. This is one reason that the orchestra, with its strong roster of players, consistently presents such well-conceived and adventurous programs. Tonight's concert, the first of the Riverside Symphony's 24th season, offers works for string orchestra. Dvorak's miraculously scored and wistfully tuneful Serenade should contrast effectively with the New York premiere of Erwin Schulhoff's Three Pieces. Though the Prague-born Schulhoff was pronounced a prodigy by Dvorak his life was cut short when he perished in a Nazi concentration camp in 1942. A more recent work completes the program: Keith Lay's ''On the Playground,'' which features the violinist Cenovia Cummins, the Riverside Symphony's fine concertmaster, as soloist. Tonight at 8, Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $45.  TOMMASINI    CHARLES ROSEN One of the keyboard world's more thoughtful, intellectual players, Charles Rosen is as renowned for his insightful books and essays as for his probing performances. But his playing is by no means bookish: as concerned as he is with the details of style and structure, he is also intent on showing composers as creatures of flesh and blood, animated by passions, desires, victories and disappointments. In the finale of his three-part series, ''The Romantic Generation'' -- the title comes from one of his books -- Mr. Rosen is examining the music of Mendelssohn and Brahms, with a particular focus on their fusing of Classical and Romantic sensibilities. Sunday at 1:30 p.m. (a lecture) and 3 (the recital), 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500. Tickets: $30.  KOZINN    RICHARD STOLTZMAN He is one of the very few clarinetists with a high-profile career as an orchestral soloist, but Richard Stoltzman has also remained deeply devoted to chamber music. Last month at Weill Recital Hall, he gave a sincere and generously expressive performance of a Mozart trio. For this recital, he is joined by the pianist Jeremy Denk in standard repertory by Schubert, Schumann, Berg and Brahms as well as the New York premiere of a work by Yehudi Wyner. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500. Tickets: $35.

AMERICAN BALLET THEATER The company's festive autumn season, which has featured works of many kinds -- dramatic and abstract, serious and comic -- closes Sunday night. Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212. Tickets: $35 to $85.  JACK ANDERSON    IVY BALDWIN The wildly imaginative Ms. Baldwin has conjured up a scarily nutty world in her new ''Now Leaving Vanderville.'' Citizens go to war only on Mondays. (Well, that doesn't sound too bad.) They also stuff ducks for a living, however, as they wait patiently to be annihilated every week. All this is set to a score of songs by Kurt Weill, performed live by Franz Nicolay and Carrie Lewis. Also on the program is ''la table,'' a duet for snobs. Tonight and tomorrow (and Thursday through next Saturday) at 8 p.m., Dixon Place, 258 Bowery, between Prince and Houston Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736 or www.dixonplace.org. Tickets: $10 and $15.  JENNIFER DUNNING    BLAK TINO PERFORMANCE SERIES Things are getting complicated in the world of ethnic nomenclature. This series, for instance, celebrates art by black, Latino and ''Blatino'' artists. The choreographers for this first of two weekends are Richard Rivera, Afua Hall, Cesar Abreu and Christopher Campbell. No word as to which category each belongs to, but Mr. Rivera and his Physual troupe are longtime presences on the South Bronx dance scene, and Ms. Hall stood out as a quietly powerful performer in recent Manhattan performances. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., BAAD! (The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance), 841 Barretto Street, Hunts Point, South Bronx, (718) 842-5223. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    * CHARLES DENNIS: 'HOMECOMING' This documentary celebrates 20 years of dance and ultimate funk at P.S. 122, of which Mr. Dennis is a co-founder. The film focuses on 10 choreographers who created seminal work there, with music by John Zorn, photography by Dona Ann McAdams and commentary by presenters and critics who include Mark Russell, for many years the theater's director and animating spirit. Sunday (and next Sunday) at 2 p.m., P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288. Tickets: $5.  DUNNING    'FOREVER TANGO' Better than Viagra, and for all ages, too. Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' features sultry and comical dancers and first-rate musicians in a show, extended through Nov. 28, that is both tacky and transcendent. Tonight (and Tuesdays and Thursdays) at 8 p.m.; tomorrow (and Wednesdays) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $45 to $85.  DUNNING    * MARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH There's buzz. He's said to be cool. And Mr. Joseph and his new ''Word Becomes Flesh'' should probably be seen, in this New York debut, for a lot of other reasons, too. Among them is his status as a featured artist in Russell Simmons's HBO Def Poetry Jam series, a National Poetry Slam Champion and a Broadway-musical child performer who became a producer of work by the next generation. Most of all, there is the piece itself. A series of letters to his unborn son, Joseph, ''Flesh'' combines music, poetry, visuals, hip-hop, tap and modern and West African dance to document a pregnancy from the point of view of a young single father. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077 or www.dtw.org. Tickets: $20.  DUNNING    MANDANCE PROJECT Eliot Feld's new choreographic endeavor brings together five men (Damian Woetzel, Wu-Kang Chen, Nickemil Concepcion, Jason Jordan and Sean Suozzi) and one woman (Patricia Tuthill) in solos, duets and group works by Mr. Feld to music ranging from Bach to jug band tunes. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tomorrow at 2 and Sunday at 3 p.m. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $42; matinees, $25 for adults, $15 for children.  ANDERSON    MEXICO HERE: MEXICAN CHOREOGRAPHERS IN NEW YORK You may not be able to go home again. But you can't ever really leave home, even when you move on to faraway New York. That is a premise of this program, in which five young Mexican choreographers now living in New York -- Geraldine Cardiel, Penelope Gonzalez, Ricardo Gomez, David Matiano, Gabriela Medina and Erick Montes -- will present dances set to composers who include Carlo Nicolau, as part of a monthlong citywide celebration of Mexican arts. Tonight at 8; Sunday at 2 p.m., Skirball Center, New York University, 566 La Guardia Place, south of Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 992-8484. Tickets: $20.  DUNNING    HIMIKO MINATO & DANCERS Ms. Minato trained in Tokyo before coming to New York in 1997 to study at the Merce Cunningham Studio and perform with Jeanette Stoner. In her new ''Yellow,'' which explores the attainability of the American dream, Ms. Minato draws on principles of Japanese Buddhism to counter American expectations of ''yellow'' or Asian people. Tonight through Sunday at 8 p.m. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $15; $12 for students and 65+.  DUNNING    NIBROLL This Tokyo-based multidisciplinary collective will perform its ''Dry Flower,'' a full-evening piece in which street action, drifting petals and stampeding gazelles share the stage. The work is new, and Japanese modern-dance and performance art is generally unpredictable but usually thought-provoking and often filled with crude but delicious humor. For the record, the dance is by Mikuni Yanaihara, the founder of the troupe in 1997. Today at noon and 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 8 p.m, the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793 x 11 or www.thekitchen.org. Tickets: $20; $16 for students and 65+; $10 for today's lunch-break program.  DUNNING    JEREMY NELSON A triple bill of recently choreographed works includes ''Accent Elimination,'' based on the different ways people may speak or move; ''Bridge of Fools,'' a trio, and ''SightUnseen,'' a dance inspired by traffic patterns. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, Second Avenue at 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.  ANDERSON    NEXT WAVE FESTIVAL: BALLET PRELJOCAJ A choreographer who defies easy classification returns to New York with ''Near Life Experience,'' an eveninglong production that explores how an instant of abandon -- be it a fainting spell, an ecstatic trance or an orgasm -- can invest corporeal realities with a sense of the transcendent. Tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. Tickets: $20 to $45. (Related review, Page 3.)  ANDERSON    * DANA SALISBURY The Bessie Award-winning Ms. Salisbury is known for dances and videos that are acutely conscious of the world around her and all of its details. In her new multimedia ''Whole-Body-Seer,'' whose title is drawn from a memoir about blindness written by John Hull, Ms. Salisbury explores the world of the blind, in terms of the senses and the imagination. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m., University Settlement, 184 Eldridge Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 929-8145. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    * STREB S.L.A.M. You could say Elizabeth Streb and her performers are sitting pretty, with their own 150-seat studio-theater in which to create new work and regularly present it. But no one sits for long at a Streb program. The dancers fly, dive and dangle in new and recent pieces. The audience can walk around, as at a fairground, with popcorn provided. Tonight and tomorrow (and next Friday and Saturday) at 7 p.m., S.L.A.M. (Streb Lab for Action Mechanics), 51 North First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 384-6491. Tickets: $15.  DUNNING    * SUNDAYS AT THREE: ALEXANDRA BELLER Ms. Beller, who danced with Bill T. Jones, is known as a lush and hurtling force of nature with a brain. In this informal free series, which combines performing and discussion, she and her company will perform dances about experiencing war and about whether we do actually exist. Sunday at 3 p.m., Harkness Dance Center, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, Manhattan. Information: (212) 415-5500. Tickets: $10.  DUNNING    * VIRSKY UKRAINIAN NATIONAL DANCE COMPANY This 85-member company of dancers and musicians, based in Kiev, has toured the world but somehow resisted becoming a tourist-office attraction. The show is sleekly staged, but the music and dance are genuinely rousing and colorful. Sunday at 2 p.m., Lehman Concert Hall, 250 Bedford Park Boulevard West, the Bronx, (718) 960-8833. Tickets: $20 to $35.  DUNNING    * WORLD MUSIC INSTITUTE: WHIRLING DERVISHES OF DAMASCUS Mesmerized and mesmerizing, the Dervishes are Sufi mystics, members of an order founded by the 13th-century Persian mystical poet Jalaluddin Rumi. Rumi believed in the ''spinning-off'' of worldly diversions to find unity with the divine. The company will be joined by Sheik Hamza Shakkur, a grand master of Muslim sacred song, and Al-Kindi, an ensemble devoted to classical Arab music. Tonight at 8:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 545-7536. Tickets: $30 and $42.  DUNNING    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent museum and gallery shows: nytimes.com/art.    Museums    'ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR,' New Museum of Contemporary Art/Chelsea, 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 219-1222, through Nov. 13. Occupying new temporary quarters on the Chelsea Art Museum's ground floor, the New Museum presents a mostly video group show that reflects the problems of adapting to the constant changes of modern experience. Robert Melee's home-entertainment center documents his adaptation to his eccentric mother; a video by Bojan Sarcevic shows a Turkish Gypsy band learning to play Western pop songs; and, best of all, a video by Kerry Tribe shows a wonderfully charismatic 10-year-old girl thoughtfully responding to philosophical questions posed by a man off camera. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3.  KEN JOHNSON    * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined elements of East and West, high and low, old and new: African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. Literature and music shaped the work no less than Picasso, George Grosz and Vermeer did. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.  MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphosing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry, and in one astonishing small sculpture, a human face splits apart to reveal the ages of man. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.  HOLLAND COTTER    * 'COMIC GROTESQUE: WIT AND MOCKERY IN GERMAN ART, 1870-1940,' Neue Galerie, 1048 Fifth Avenue at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, through Feb. 14. The horrors of World War I are usually credited with triggering the dark, often scathing humor that was used to comment on and combat some very unfunny developments in Germany in the first four decades of the century. But the Neue Galerie's splendidly multimedia revisionist show takes a broader view. It pinpoints paintings by Arnold Böcklin from the 1870's as a point of origin and then sweeps forward in a selective yet encompassing manner, touching on painting, poetry, graphic design and popular entertainment. It shows the influences of the satiric illustrator Thomas Theodor Heine on the mordant anti-Nazi montages of John Heartfield; places artists like Lionel Feininger and Alfred Kubin in context; and includes reconstructions of puppets made and used in performance by Heartfield, George Grosz and Hannah Höch. It culminates in the films of the great Karl Valentin, the star of stage, screen and cabaret who was Germany's Charlie Chaplin. Saturdays to Mondays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 65+, $7.  ROBERTA SMITH    'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. And in these portraits, mostly of upper-class offspring, to be sure, he tended to get more real. This show, presenting about 40 works on the subject, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how Sargent's likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood that came into play at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first exhibition to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show, with its catalog, is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 62+, $4.  GRACE GLUECK    * 'PRINCELY SPLENDOR: THE DRESDEN COURT, 1580-1620,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 30. A densely baubled selection of some of the tools, armor, sculpture and bejeweled gewgaws that the princes of Dresden accumulated in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Ignore the hackneyed and pompous exhibition title and consider this a constructive reminder of the artistic roots of wonderment. Besides ivory handled hammers, a 14-piece pocketknife, a mother-of-pearl cup in the shape of a parrot, silk doublets trimmed in silver and gold, a brass horn, and several automatons, which move about on hidden mechanized wheels, there is a portable hunting and writing desk. It is neatly stocked with gardening tools, writing and painting implements, cupping glasses, an oil cruet, soap boxes, scales, strainers, funnels, vintner's tools, barber's instruments, farrier's tools, locksmith tools -- in sum, the world, as a mirror of divine reason, a cabinet of wonders, for princes who had everything. Hours and admission: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.  KIMMELMAN    'GILBERT STUART,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 16. Known today mostly for his multiple images of George Washington, 14 of which are shown here, Stuart (1755-1828) painted many other faces, famous and not, as seen in this full-blown retrospective. Among them were Thomas Jefferson; John and Abigail Adams; the fur magnate John Jacob Astor; and countless British and American blueboods. Possessed of a penetrating talent augmented by a knowledge of physiognomy, Stuart apparently sussed out his subjects in lively conversation as he worked. The last Stuart retrospective was held nearly 40 years ago; this one reveals for a new generation that he was and remains one of our greatest American painters. Hours and admission: see above.  GLUECK    'TOTEMS TO TURQUOISE: NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN JEWELRY ARTS OF THE NORTHWEST AND SOUTHWEST,' American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West at 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, through July 10. Think of cave murals and Renaissance altarpieces used to contextualize examples of modern and contemporary painting and you've got the equivalent of this exhibition, a mixed bag of old and new, quality and special pleading. Here examples of jewelry and other small objects that date back to prehistoric times lend credence to late 20th and 21st century works that are sometimes little more than glitzy knockoffs. Enough recent efforts stand out to make the show a valuable essay on the very notion of traditions, how they are formed, perpetuated, renewed, exploited or exhausted. But claiming to follow the beliefs or crafts of one's ancestors does not guarantee a special purchase on spirituality. All art is essentially a faith-based initiative. Hours: Daily, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m. Admission: $13; children, $7.50; students and 62+, $10.  SMITH    Galleries: Uptown    'BOB THE ROMAN: HEROIC ANTIQUITY AND THE ARCHITECTURE OF ROBERT ADAM,' Gallery of the New York School of Interior Design, 161 East 69th Street, (212) 472-1500, through Dec. 4. Not for nothing did the Scotsman Robert Adam (1728-1792) playfully restyle himself ''Bob the Roman'' after soaking up the Eternal City on his youthful grand tour of Europe. Nearly everything he turned his hand to later as the celebrated architect, designer and interior decorator of late 18th-century England evoked the classical spirit of his beloved Rome. This show of more than 80 drawings made in the Adam office (Robert's brother, James, was his partner) is an enlightening introduction to the Adam brothers' scope. The works range from a nine-foot-long view of the facade of an intricate fantasy palace to numerous plans and proposals for town houses, villas and castles, along with their ornamentation, many of which actually got built. The show provides a fine glimpse of Robert Adam's role in helping to put an elegant and decorative new face on 18th-century English architecture.  GLUECK    GORDON COSTER, Keith de Lellis, 47 East 68th Street, (212) 327-1482, through Nov. 12. This retrospective exhibition of more than 60 photographs dating from 1925 to 1950 documents the career of a versatile and skillful photojournalist. It includes semi-abstract still-lifes and nudes, documentary pictures of inner city life and labor and civil rights strife and pictures of idyllic family scenes made for magazine ads that are, in some ways, among the show's most provocative images.  JOHNSON    ALFRED LESLIE: 'EXPRESSING THE ZEITGEIST,' Allan Stone Gallery, 113 East 90th Street, (212) 987-4997, through Dec. 22. Although thought of today primarily as a realist painter, Alfred Leslie started out as a second-generation Abstract Expressionist, a mover and shaker of the downtown world whose studio was a center of happenings and other events besides painting. This presentation of his vibrant early work from 1951 to 1962 ranges from tiny collages to large canvases, whose colors, chosen from a broad palette, were energetically laid on with heavy, loaded brushstrokes exuberantly accompanied by drips and spatter. They characteristically carry a pair or two of painted bars that punctuate the highly textured, often collaged surfaces like exclamation points.  GLUECK    * 'NEUE SACHLICHKEIT: NEW OBJECTIVITY IN WEIMAR GERMANY,' Ubu Gallery, 416 East 59th Street, (212) 753-4444, through Dec. 18. Heralded by the Expressionist Ludwig Meidner as a ''fanatical, fervent naturalism,'' the ostensibly realist style known as Neue Sachlichkeit was all that and more, as this uneven 80-work show vigorously suggests. It features the majestically factual photographs of August Sander, Karl Blossfeldt and Albert Renger-Patzsch, and works based on photographs by Georg Scholz, Eddy Smith and George Grosz that bring out reality's grotesque side. Carl Grossberg's pared-down, jewel-colored portrayals of German factories and villages evoke American Precisionism.  SMITH    Galleries: 57th Street    SAM CADY: 'MAINE, NEW PAINTINGS,' Mary Ryan Gallery 24 West 57th Street, (212) 397-0669, through Nov. 24. The state of Maine may have inspired more artists than any other in the Union, and here's another devoted example. In this group of mostly shaped canvases, closely tailored to fit the subjects, Mr. Cady celebrates the coastal village he lives in, where boats are built, fish are caught and seagulls clamor. But the painting is a little too slick to be all that down-homey.  GLUECK    TOMOKO SAWADA: 'COSTUME,' Zabriskie Gallery 41 East 57th Street, (212) 752-1224, through Nov. 13. In the tradition of Claude Cahun, Ana Mendieta and Cindy Sherman, the Japanese artist Tomoko Sawada puts female identity through its paces, but without limiting her role-playing to the studio. She enters the real world, to pose as a dentist, policewoman, secretary, nun, tea-house hostess in what might be called their natural habitats. What's most interesting is the way Ms. Sawada adjusts her facial expression and body language to each persona, and moreover to our preconceptions about the women's social status and psychological profile. The images need one another to be most effective, but in nearly every case, Ms. Sawada's performance is more than skin-deep, which is why it unsettles.  SMITH    DONALD SULTAN: 'NEW POPPY PAINTINGS,' Ameringer Yohe, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 445-0051, through Nov. 13. Mr. Sultan builds his massive pictures of flat, brightly colored poppy blossoms on velvety black fields out of industrial strength materials: plywood, masonite, linoleum, tar and enamel paint. Far from heavy-handed or over-bearing, however, his works exude a suave and seductive blend of visual and tactile sensuousness.  JOHNSON    WAYNE THIEBAUD, 'JUST DESSERTS,' Susan Sheehan, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 489-3331, through Dec. 18. No one did more to reanimate the tired old genre of still life painting in the last half century than did Mr. Thiebaud with his paintings of industrially regimented food products. His prints, sampled here in a 50-year retrospective, are less exciting than his paintings. Most are in black and white and on the small side. But they still convey the artist's wry vision of modern consumerism with forthright graphic efficiency, and the full-color prints of cans of paint, a row of lipsticks and a white rabbit are lovely.  JOHNSON    Galleries: SoHo    'THE ART OF READING,' Poets House, 72 Spring Street, (212) 431-7920, through Nov. 22. This appropriately quiet presentation of 38 small paintings, drawings, prints and photographs of people reading includes Paul Cadmus's portrait of Glenway Wescott; David Hockney's sweet colored pencil drawing of a young man reclining on a sofa; photographs of William S. Burroughs by Allen Ginsberg; and King Babar (the elephant) reading his newspaper at the beach in a watercolor by Laurent DeBrunhoff.  JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea    DONALD JUDD/ROBERT MANGOLD, PaceWildenstein, 534 West 25th Street, (212) 929-7000, through Nov. 13. The pairing of the paintings and sculptures of these major Minimalist artists is a no-brainer. But it looks surprisingly fresh and is beautifully installed. Each artist works with simple volumes of space, whether actual or illusionistic, that are divided and measured with the addition of repeating related elements. In Mr. Mangold's two or three lines undulate or curve from top to across the lightly gridded monochrome color-fields of his tall ''Column'' paintings. The divisions of Mr. Judd's boxed or columnar volumes of space proceed with perpendicular planes or repeating sometimes subdivided units. A large concrete floor piece with one-quarter of its interior sectioned is especially imposing in the way it complicates simplicity.  SMITH    JEFF LADOUCEUR: 'SCHMO,' ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 229-1088, through Nov. 13. With a finely pointed pen in black ink and a meticulous touch, this Vancouver-based artist draws cartoons about a bald, long-nosed, sad sack of a character called ''Schmo.'' Our hero's struggles with ordinary existence and surrealistic encounters with cloud-creatures, tiny elephants, octopuses and an abominable snowman are funny, weird and touching.  JOHNSON    KURT LIGHTNER: 'A VIEW ALMOST PICTURESQUE,' Clementine, 526 West 26th Street, (212) 243-5937, through Nov. 13. A single huge and enthralling landscape occupies Clementine's main gallery. Measuring 12 by 22 feet, it presents a life-size, magically vivid squirrel's eye view into a forest. Part Pre-Raphaelite, part Charles Burchfield and part Walt Disney, it was made by gluing thousands of individual images of plants, trees, stones and ferns -- each painted in acrylic ink on Mylar -- onto big paper panels.  JOHNSON    VICTOR VASARELY: 'BLACK AND WHITE PAINTINGS FROM THE 1950'S,' Robert Miller, 524 West 26th Street, (212) 366-4774, through Nov. 13. This small but surprisingly interesting sideshow presents just six black and white paintings dating from 1952 to 1962. This Hungarian-born painter, who lived from 1906 to 1997, came to be thought of as a visual cheap trickster, but the optically tantalizing compositions of stripes, grid patterns and patterns like bar codes on view here have a fine, concentrated rigor.  JOHNSON    Other Galleries    'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life.  COTTER    * FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION NATIONAL MONUMENT, Foley Square, Lower Manhattan, (212) 206-6674, through Nov. 13. On a return engagement sponsored by Creative Time and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, this interactive outdoor sculpture, made in the symbolic year 1984, consists of a big, bright red Constructivist-style megaphone, through which members of the public can exercise their right to free speech. The work is a collaboration among the architect Laurie Hawkinson, the artist Erika Rothenberg and the performer John Malpede. It points, perhaps appropriately, toward the state and federal courthouses.  SMITH    'THE PRESIDENCY,' Exit Art, 475 10th Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 966-7745, through Nov. 21. Among the few interesting pieces in this weak selection of politically tendentious works by 41 artists are Arbuzo Virtmanis's corrugated cardboard reconstruction of the president's bedroom on Air Force One; a deadpan video cartoon by Packard Jennings in which President Bush and members of his cabinet say things they would say if they were being completely honest; and an audio piece by 31 Down Radio Theater in which the president humbly apologizes for things he has done, from running for president to invading Iraq.  JOHNSON    SITE, Senior & Shopmaker, 21 East 26th Street, (212) 213-6767, through Dec. 4. A cool new addition to Madison Square Park is the ''Shake Shack,'' a fast-food kiosk designed by the architecture firm Sculpture in the Environment (SITE) that was founded in 1970 by James Wines. It is partly a postmodern hot dog stand, partly green architecture with its vegetation-covered roof and partly a way to generate revenue for the park. The small show of models and drawings at Senior & Shopmaker gives some background on this inventive and admirable effort to integrate form, function and environment.  JOHNSON    Last Chance    GEORGE CONDO, 'PAINTINGS FROM THE EIGHTIES,' Briggs Robinson, 527 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 560-9075, through Nov. 9. Mr. Condo emerged in the context of the wildly subversive, early 80's East Village scene with his own painterly fusions of Pop, neo-expressionism, neo-surrealism and cartooning. With his images of clowns and goofy anthropomorphic animals, his inventive mimicry of artists like Picasso and Dalí and his insouciant play with abstraction, he lampooned high-culture pretentiousness while obliquely revealing a peculiarly emotional and anxious inner life. His paintings from the 80's are still funny, odd and affecting.  JOHNSON    'DON'T CALL IT PERFORMANCE,' Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, through Sunday. Performative seems to be the preferred term now for performance art, to distinguish it from theater. Whatever, it's alive and kicking here, with short videos by 30 artists, mostly Latino or Latin American but including some North American and European colleagues, on view. The work is uneven, but you do get a sense that a younger generation is keeping performative work a vital presence in the art world. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; $4 for students and 65+.  GLUECK    GEORGE RICKEY, 'RETROSPECTIVE,' Maxwell Davidson, 724 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 759-7555, through tomorrow. Followers of Rickey's Modernist mobiles and whirly-gigs will enjoy this selection of small indoor works from five decades. Gently buffeted by electric fans set up in the gallery, elegantly composed and delicately balanced sets of metal blades, propellers, fins and panels move in slow, gracefully choreographed rhythms to soothing, hypnotic effect.

" Movies    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.    Now Playing    'BEING JULIA' Starring Annette Bening. Directed by Istvan Szabo (R, 103 minutes). A flimsy frame surrounding a marvelous performance. As Julia Lambert, an aging star of the prewar London stage, Ms. Bening swoops from melodrama to farce with splendid hauteur and touching fragility. Julia, whose marriage to her long-time director (Jeremy Irons) has long been a primarily professional attachment, falls into an affair with Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), a sweet-faced, penniless American who turns out to be a callow adventurer. In tracing the phases of her affair -- from rapture to heartbreak to revenge -- the film is too busy and plodding to develop an emotional core, and Mr. Evans has all the sexual magnetism of a boiled potato. The rest of the cast supports Ms. Bening gallantly, and she lifts the movie from the costume-drama doldrums by sheer dazzling force of will.   A. O. SCOTT    'A DIRTY SHAME' Starring Tracey Ullman and Johnny Knoxville. Written and directed by John Waters (NC-17, 89 minutes). A crashing bore is more like it. Mr. Waters's latest movie once again pits unruly, life-affirming sex maniacs against uptight prudes. The line between them is blurry: the heroine, Sylvia Stickles (Ms. Ullman), starts out as a repressed suburban mother and, after suffering a concussion, goes on a libidinous rampage. She joins a sex-addict cult (led by Mr. Knoxville), which is devoted to discovering a hitherto undreamed-of kink that will unlock the erotic secrets of the universe. The movie sounds like more fun than it is, but Mr. Waters, after more than 35 years of moviemaking, remains a determined amateur. If his jokes were still funny, or his attitudes still provocative, the crudeness of the picture would be less bothersome, but the net effect of all the energetic naughtiness is like that of being in a room full of 8-year-old boys who have just learned some new swear words.   SCOTT    'THE FORGOTTEN' Starring Julianne Moore, Dominic West and Gary Sinise. Directed by Joseph Ruben (PG-13, 100 minutes). In this preposterous thriller, a pseudo-spiritual, mumbo-jumbo, sciencefiction-inflected mess, Mr. Ruben does not just fail to tap into the talent of his luminous star, Ms. Moore; he barely gets her attention. As Telly, a Brooklyn mother in mourning, Ms. Moore delivers a performance that has all the emotional commitment of a bored kid playing with a light switch. Even after Telly discovers that all the images of her dead son have been erased from the photographs scattered around her home, Ms. Moore keeps flipping the switch: sad, not sad; sad, not sad. Initially, the disappearing images are explained away by Telly's creepy psychiatrist, Dr. Munce (Mr. Sinise), who insists that the boy never existed and that after suffering a miscarriage, she invented him out of thin air. Telly finds this hard to believe (she isn't the only one) and embarks on a Search for the Truth involving cheap thrills, emotional uplift and some nonsense about the eternal mother.   MANOHLA DARGIS    'FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' Starring Billy Bob Thornton. Directed by Peter Berg (PG-13, 105 minutes). Mr. Berg directs this Texas high school football extravaganze in a tough, gritty style that gives it an unusually fine and vivid sense of place. The place in question is Odessa, a West Texas town where football is more than just an obsession; it's the foundation of the social order and the source of life's meaning. The film, based on H. G. Bissinger's 1990 book of reportage, follows a handful of senior athletes and their put-upon coach (Mr. Thornton) through an anxious season. The town wants a state championship, and in trying to satisfy this expectation the young men face extraordinary risks and sacrifices. Conventional as it is, ''Friday Night Lights'' is both rousing and honest, and it features good performances from Derek Luke, as the team's star runner, and Lucas Black as its anxious quarterback.   SCOTT    * 'I (heart) HUCKABEES' Starring Dustin Hoffman, Isabelle Huppert, Jude Law, Jason Schwartzman and Lily Tomlin. Directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). This high-wire comedy captures liberal-left despair with astonishingly good humor: it's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' for the screwball set. Choc-a-block with strange bedfellows -- Mr. Hoffman and Ms. Tomlin play a hot-and-heavy married couple, Mr. Schwartzman gets his groove on with Ms. Huppert -- the film is a snort-out-loud-funny master class of controlled chaos. In this topsy-turvy world, where yes is the new corporate no and businesses sponsor environmental causes while bulldozing over Ranger Rick, a pair of existential detectives sift through a client's trash to solve the riddle of his malaise. Like Mr. Russell, they gladly risk foolishness to plunge into the muck of human existence. The film is loud, messy, aggressively in your face and generally played for the back row in the theater, and it doesn't offer up solutions, tender any comfort or rejoice in the triumph of the human spirit. All we can do, says Mr. Russell, is keep pushing the rock back uphill. That's kind of a bummer, but in its passion, energy and go-for-broke daring, in its faith in the possibility of human connection (if not its probability), ''I   Huckabees'' provides its own reason for hope.   DARGIS    'LADDER 49' Starring Joaquin Phoenix and John Travolta. Directed by Jay Russell (PG-13, 115 minutes). In ''Ladder 49'' fires smolder and rage and generally act in a far more lively and persuasive fashion than any of the men struggling to put them out. A sob story, the film stars Mr. Phoenix as Jack Morrison, a once and future hero who battles untold infernos, saves untold lives and quaffs untold draft beers to become a fireman's fireman, the kind who fearlessly enters burning buildings and puts everything at risk, including a picture-perfect family and a self so radically unexamined, so thin and vaporous, it's a wonder it doesn't drift off the screen along with all the billows of enveloping smoke. Pegged as a true-to-life story, one meant to put a lump in your throat and a tear in your eye, this is essentially a male weepy about strong, simple men and the strong, simple women behind them, and as such it's platitudinous rubbish. What makes this nonsense more galling than usual is that while ''Ladder 49'' might have started out as a heartfelt attempt to honor those in the line of literal fire, it weighs in as an attempt to exploit their post-Sept. 11 symbolism.   DARGIS    * 'THE MOTORCYCLE DIARIES' Starring Gael García Bernal and Rodrigo de la Serna. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 126 minutes; in Spanish, with English subtitles). In 1952 Alberto Granado, a 29-year-old chemist, and his pal Ernesto Guevara, a 23-year-old medical student, set out from Buenos Aires to explore South America. Their journey might have vanished into private recollection were it not for the fact that Ernesto went on to become Che, political idol, revolutionary martyr and pillar of the T-shirt industry. Mr. Salles's film, based on Granado and Guevara's notebooks, is partly a political coming-of-age story in which Ernesto (Mr. Bernal) awakens to the injustice that plagues the continent. But the movie is also a rambunctious buddy picture (thanks in part to Mr. de la Serna's high-spirited portrayal of the Falstaffian Granado), a breathtaking travelogue and an unusual love story. The love in question is Ernesto's sensual and spiritual connection to the continent itself, beautifully communicated through Eric Gautier's sublime cinematography. Mr. Bernal's soulful performance is sure to enhance his reputation as one of the most magnetic young actors around, but the real stars of the movie are the rugged Chilean highlands, the peaks of the Andes and the misty banks of the Peruvian Amazon.   SCOTT    'RAISE YOUR VOICE' Starring Hilary Duff. Directed by Sean McNamara (PG, 97 minutes). Ms. Duff, as Terri Fletcher, redefines the word ''pep.'' But when tragedy strikes her family, Terri loses her voice (her great joy is singing) and her love of life. The only thing that might snap her out of it would be attending a very hard to get into summer-music program in Los Angeles, but her hardheaded father (David Keith) objects. It takes deception and the help of a free-spirited aunt (Rebecca De Mornay) to get her there. Predictably, the big city lives up to its bad reputation at first, but chances are good that Terri will find her voice again, teach her parents a lesson and get the guy (Oliver James). Thinking adults won't find much of ''Raise Your Voice'' worth their time, but this piece of fluff's infectious high spirits will appeal to young moviegoers without conveying any sinister messages, beyond the suggestion that soul-crushing grief can be ''cured'' in the short space of a summer.     ANITA GATES    'SHALL WE DANCE?' Starring Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Peter Chelsom (PG-13, 106 minutes). This Americanization of a popular 1996 Japanese film is an old-fashioned feel-good fantasy that piles on the euphoria. The movie returns Mr. Gere to the site of his hoofing triumph in ''Chicago.'' His character is a mild-mannered estate lawyer, happily married with two teenage children, who on an impulse starts taking evening ballroom dancing classes. As he evolves from bland suburban frog into suave dance-floor prince, he regains his faltering zest for life and refreshes his marriage (to Ms. Sarandon). Ms. Lopez, in full sizzle, is the dedicated instructor who teaches him that ballroom dancing, as she puts it, is ''a vertical expression of a horizontal wish.''   STEPHEN HOLDEN    'SHARK TALE' With the voices of Will Smith, Robert De Niro, Renée Zellweger, Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Vicky Jenson, Bibo Bergeron and Rob Letterman (PG, 92 minutes). Swimming in the lucrative wake of ''Finding Nemo,'' DreamWorks's foray into computer-generated underwater animation is a rambunctious, reasonably amusing pop confection. Where Pixar goes for sublimity and sincerity, DreamWorks continues to prefer a jokey, referential style, full of bright colors, almost-offensive ethnic stereotypes, big-name movie stars and easy cultural references that sail over the heads of the children in the audience and splatter in their parents' faces. Mr. Smith, as charming in fins and scales as in the flesh, is Oscar, a fish who becomes a celebrity after falsely taking credit for killing a mobbed-up shark. Mr. Black is the dead shark's vegetarian brother, Mr. De Niro is the shark capo, and Ms. Zellweger and Ms. Jolie are competing romantic interests, the latter a slinky, pouty fish fatale.   SCOTT    'SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW' Starring Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi. Written and directed by Kerry Conran (PG, 107 minutes). In this movie's elegant murk, Mr. Law and Ms. Paltrow slip into comic-book archetypes of the dashing aviator and the intrepid girl reporter with supreme confidence. When Mr. Conran's remarkable filmmaking debut remembers that storytelling and characters matter more than design and special effects, the movie charms as well as impresses. If nothing else, it is a landmark of computer-generated images, with actors cavorting through an entirely synthetic, retro-styled future world that fuses Art Deco, Futurism, Fritz Lang's ''Metropolis'' and the spirit of the 1939 World's Fair into an all-purpose eve-of-World War II environment extrapolated into a science-fiction limbo. But its visual elegance comes at a price. Its ethereal evocation of a pulp-fiction future-past eclipses almost any other sci-fi franchise in subtlety and imagination, but shadowy washed-out color is a far cry from the robust hues of a movie like ''Raiders of the Lost Ark.''   HOLDEN    'STAGE BEAUTY' Starring Billy Crudup and Claire Danes. Directed by Richard Eyre (R, 105 minutes). A 17th-century ''Star Is Born,'' though with interestingly convoluted sexual politics and a provocative historical thesis. Mr. Crudup is Ned Kynaston, one of the biggest stars of the London stage, who specializes in playing Shakespearean heroines. Ms. Danes is Maria, his loyal, ambitious dresser, who, with the help of the king's mistress, ends the long ban on female performers, thus destroying Ned's career. In spite of a sludgy Sunday-brunch score and a weak performance from Ms. Danes, the film explores its period with rare precision and with a lively sense of intellectual curiosity. Much of this is squandered, though, in a flat and conventional final act that turns Ned and Maria into the inventors of Method acting and, recoiling from its earlier subtlety, celebrates a world where men are men and women are women.   SCOTT    * 'TEAM AMERICA: WORLD POLICE' With the voices of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Directed by Mr. Parker (R, 98 minutes). Without question the finest R-rated puppet action-musical of the past decade. Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone, the creators of ''South Park,'' apply their foulmouthed ingenuity to blow-'em-up cinema and current geopolitics. Saddam Hussein, a key character in the ''South Park'' movie, has been replaced by Kim Jong Il, a bespectacled blend of Eric Cartman and Professor Chaos, who plots to arm terrorists with weapons of mass destruction. If that doesn't sound like a laughing matter, fear not: there are plenty of profane, catchy songs and giddily offensive jokes to keep you amused. But like any good satire, this film has a distinct moral point of view. The members of Team America, the square-jawed action heroes who take on Kim and his supporting cast of left-wing Hollywood stooges, may blow up a lot of stuff, but they do it by accident, not by design. And while the movie is happy to mock American bluster, it also expresses a blunt, uncynical patriotism.   SCOTT    * 'VERA DRAKE' Starring Imelda Staunton and Phil Davis. Written and directed by Mike Leigh (R, 125 minutes). In this new film about a back-street abortionist, the moment invariably comes when the title character asks her client to bring her some boiling water. Vera's affect is so cozy, as nurturing as a maternal bosom, that it's always somewhat of a surprise when you remember that the water isn't for a warming cup of tea, but for the solution she dispenses. That's very much to Mr. Leigh's point since Vera wants nothing so much as to support the frightened, the dismayed and the impoverished who seek her help, who come to this tender dumpling of a woman because they believe they have no other choice. Here, the politics of abortion isn't a position that individuals can take and leave at will; it's what drives women underground to someone like Vera, with her clucks and smiles, her bar of lye soap and all that hot water. Set in London in 1950, and suffused with humanity rather than dogma, the film is easily Mr. Leigh's best work in a decade.   DARGIS    Rock/Pop    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy rock and popconcerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent rock and pop performances: nytimes.com/music.    * AGAINST ME!/BLOOD BROTHERS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111. An appealing double-bill starring two different bands of punk-rock eccentrics. Against Me!, from Gainesville, Fla., specializes in roaring, galloping folk songs. And the Blood Brothers, from Seattle, compose screaming (but sly) tantrums; their new album is ''Crimes'' (V2), which includes a jagged, wriggly ballad called, ''Peacock's Skeleton With Crooked Feathers''; for maximum enjoyment, bring a lyric sheet to the show and follow along. Tonight at 8, with True North; tickets are $12.   KELEFA SANNEH    BROTHERS PAST, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. A jam band that leans toward jazz-rock, the Brothers Past thrive on odd meters and sudden shifts from vamp to vamp. Tomorrow night at 11:30; tickets are $10 in advance, $12 tomorrow.   JON PARELES    * DANU, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Danu is an Irish traditional band that plays old-fashioned acoustic instruments, with a repertory that reaches from fierce fiddle reels to pensive ballads. Its arrangements show an ear for texture that allows for both drive and delicacy. Tonight at 7:30; admission is $18.   PARELES    * DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. This indie-rock band was responsible for one of 2003's best albums, ''Translatanticism'' (Barsuk), which contained 11 impeccable songs about lovers just out of reach. The guitarist and producer Chris Walla stripped the music down so you could hear every hum and sigh, and Ben Gibbard peeled back layers as he sang, often starting with a vivid metaphor and ending with a memorable plea. The live show is a bit louder and messier than the pristine album -- Mr. Gibbard doesn't miss a beat, but he does sometimes miss the microphone. Expect him to sound lovely, regardless. Tonight at 6:45, with Pretty Girls Make Graves; tickets are $21 in advance, $24 tonight.     SANNEH    ELYSIAN FIELDS, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. Elysian Fields plays languid songs that sound best in a late-night haze, as Jennifer Charles's breathy voice hints at decadence and vulnerability while Oren Bloedow wraps the songs in slinky, deadpan guitar. Tonight at midnight; admission is $5.   PARELES    VICENTE FERNANDEZ, Theater at Madison Square Garden, 33rd Street and Seventh Avenue, Manhattan, (212) 465-6741. In Mexico, Vicente Fernandez is a household name, a television star who owes his fame to songs about loving, crying and suffering. With his dramatic tenor voice and his wall-shaking vibrato, Mr. Fernandez brings out all the melodrama of Mexican ranchera songs, which bounce and laugh as they detail vast heartaches. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $54.50 to $139.50.   PARELES    GALACTIC, Stone Pony, 913 Ocean Avenue, Asbury Park, N.J., (732) 502-0600 and Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Union Square, (212) 777-6800. Galactic carries on the second-line groove tradition of its hometown, New Orleans, with easy-rolling funk tunes that add a horn section to the syncopated subtleties of the Meters. At the Stone Pony tonight at 8; tickets are $18 in advance, $20 at the door. At Irving Plaza tomorrow night at 8, with Scratch (formerly of the Roots) opening, and Sunday night at 8 with Mike Doughty and JJ Grey opening; tickets are $25.   PARELES    * AL GREEN,Westbury Music Fair, 960 Brush Hollow Road, Westbury, N.Y. (516) 334-0800, and Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070. Soul oldies meet gospel testifying in Al Green's highly unpredictable performances. He sings, he preaches, he dances, he tosses roses to the ladies. He jumps in and out of songs and teases the crowd with his timing and his whims. Sometimes he makes songs like ''Let's Stay Together' sound like aching, immediate pleas, and sometimes the audience ends up singing more than he does, but he's never less than charismatic. Stephanie Mills, who moved between Broadway (''The Wiz'') and pop-soul hits in the 1970's and 80's, opens at Westbury. But at the Beacon, Mr. Green is paired with another great gospel-steeped singer: Mavis Staples, whose husky voice holds both reverence and earthly sensuality. Her current album, ''Have a Little Faith'' (Alligator), is her first in a decade, and it shows she has held on to every bit of her sultry fervor. At Westbury tonight at 8; tickets are $56.50. At the Beacon tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $45 to $85.     PARELES    * JUNIOR BOYS, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111; Other Music, 15 East 4th Street, East Village, (212) 477-8150. Domino Records just reissued this Canadian group's suave debut album, ''Last Exit,'' which synthesizes different iterations of electonica: dubby microhouse, old-fashioned new wave, futuristic R & B. On the title track, Jeremy Greenspan sighs woe-is-us lyrics over rippling, hiccupping rhythms. And during the last song, ''When I'm Not Around,'' as a saxophone materializes, unexpectedly but gently, to nudge the CD toward its conclusion. Tomorrow night at the Bowery Ballroom at 10, opening for the appealing local guitar-tronica duo Ratatat and the fiddly German electro-pop act Mouse on Mars; tickets are $14. Sunday evening at Other Music at 7; admission is free.   SANNEH    * KANDA BONGO MAN, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. Kanda Bongo Man is one of the suavest singers in Congolese pop, where suavity is king. He helped turn the lilting guitar rumbas of soukous into the even more upbeat style called kwassa kwassa, crooning over a skein of luminous guitars. Tomorrow night at midnight; admission is $25.   PARELES    THE LAST OF THE INTERNATIONAL PLAYBOYS/MAIN SQUEEZE ORCHESTRA, Fez (downstairs at the Time Cafe), 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Accordions and more accordions are on the bill as the Last of the International Playboys, a loungey, eclectic nine-piece band led by Walter Kuehr on accordion and bassoon, is reinforced by his other project: the 18-woman, 18-accordion Main Squeeze Orchestra, which he conducts. It's Mr. Kuehr's birthday. Tomorrow night at 7; tickets are $12 in advance, $15 tomorrow.     PARELES    * LITTLE BRAZIL, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733. A band led by Landon Hedges, an Omaha singer-songwriter who has spent time with both Desaparecidos and the Good Life. Mr. Hedges has a skewed, boyish warble, which pulls his sweet and tuneful indie-rock songs slightly askew; ''Now,'' from the group's forthcoming debut album (on the Seattle-based Mt. Fuji Records), has a simple chord progression, a swaying 6/8 beat and lots of sighing-then-screaming mood changes; by the time you're finished figuring out whether you like it, the song's already over -- and, more likely than not, already stuck in your head. Tonight at 8:30; tickets are $8.     SANNEH    * LYLE LOVETT/JOHN HIATT/JOE ELY/GUY CLARK, Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway at 74th Street, (212) 496-7070. Three Texans and a ringer from Indiana share this bill of smart, down-home songwriters. Lyle Lovett uses the ache in his voice to sound utterly heartfelt even when his songs grow wry and absurd, while his limber band covers the Texas spectrum from swing to honky-tonk to gospel. John Hiatt, who was born in Indianapolis, sings about loyalty, love and the full range of human eccentricity with his deep-diving baritone and unlikely rhymes. Joe Ely's songs encompass a West Texas of cowboys and cockfights, honky-tonks and wide-open spaces, country and rockabilly and rhythm-and-blues, and Guy Clark writes cozy, aphoristic songs about the pleasures of friendship, romance and home-grown tomatoes. Tonight at 8; tickets are $38.50 to $78.50.   PARELES    * PHIL ROY, Satalla, 37 West 26th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-1155. The first words on Phil Roy's most recent album, ''Issues + Options'' (Or Music) are, ''I've got a feeling something's wrong.'' An undercurrent of raw melancholy runs through his songs, making him a kindred spirit to brooding types like Leonard Cohen, John Martyn and Peter Gabriel. He often sings in a thoughtful tenor with a backup of folky guitars, and occasionally he rasps like a haggard rocker, but he's always full of clear-eyed compassion. Tomorrow night at 7:30; admission is $15.   PARELES    ROGER SANCHEZ, Crobar, 530 West 28th Street, Chelsea, (212) 629-9000. Mr. Sanchez, a local D.J. and producer, helped invent contemporary New York dance music, occasionally adding Latin rhythms to his clattering house-inspired beats. Ever since his 2002 award for a No Doubt remix, he's invariably called a ''Grammy-winning D.J.,'' although that title seems like faint praise. This past August he issued ''Release Yourself Vol. 3'' (Stealth), an appealing double-disc mix that starts with gauzy, disco-influenced mood music and ends with Carl Kennedy's buoyant and precise house track, ''The Love You Bring Me.'' Tomorrow night after 10; tickets are $20 in advance, more at the door.   SANNEH    THE SECTION QUARTET, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. The Section Quartet is a string quartet that plays rock events like the Coachella Festival; for this show, it's performing its transcriptions of Radiohead's album 'OK Computer.' Tonight at 11; admission is $10.   PARELES    GENO SITSON, Aaron Davis Hall, City College, West 135th Street and Convent Avenue, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-6900. Geno Sitson, a New Yorker from Cameroon, sings modal songs that repatriate African-influenced jazz. Also, using his body for percussion, he performs vocal solos that evoke all sorts of voices, instruments and natural sounds, as if Bobby McFerrin had a brother steeped in African polyphony. Tomorrow at 2; admission is free, but reservations are required.   PARELES    TOWER OF POWER, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Times Square, (212) 997-4144. A funk band from Oakland, Calif., that's renowned for the punch of its horn section, Tower of Power has persevered since the 1970's, concentrating less on songs (though it had moderate hits with ''So Very Hard to Go'' and ''Don't Change Horses'' in the early 1970's) than on a danceable groove. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8 and 10:30; tickets are $25.50 in advance, $30 the day of the show.   PARELES    YONDER MOUNTAIN STRING BAND, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Yonder Mountain String Band, from Colorado, carries a traditionalist bluegrass lineup -- banjo, guitar, mandolin and bass, with high vocal harmonies and no drums -- onto the jam-band circuit, picking its way through songs of wanderlust and thwarted love. Tonight at 8; tickets are $22 in advance, $25 at the door.   PARELES    YOSHIDA BROTHERS/AKIRA SATAKE, Leonard Nimoy Thalia, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. The shamisen is a Japanese stringed instrument with a bright, snapping attack that can sound a lot like a banjo to American ears, and music from Tsugaru, in northern Japan, bounces along like bluegrass. The Yoshida Brothers build modern tunes, with touches of rock and jazz, on a foundation of traditional shamisen music. To test the bluegrass connection, Akira Satake, a banjo player, opens the concert picking Appalachian tunes. Tomorrow at 3 and 8; tickets are $25, $21 for World Music Institute members.   PARELES    Jazz    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert. Full reviews of recent jazz performances: nytimes.com/music.    ERIC ALEXANDER QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. A young tenor saxophonist with a beautiful sound, centering in the Coltrane-ish lower-middle register; if he is a little unabashedly entranced by a particular area of jazz's past, around 1955 to 1965, he does well by it. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20.   BEN RATLIFF    JOHN BENITEZ QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. This Puerto Rican bassist has become one of the most valuable parts of the new Latin-jazz scene in New York; he has recently been seen leading a number of different bands, and this is yet another. It includes Luis Bonilla on trombone, Ivan Renta on bass, and Patrick Forero on drums. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $15 per set.   RATLIFF    * DIZZY ALUMNI ALLSTARS, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. This has become an annual homage to Dizzy Gillespie during his birthday week. It's usually led by Jon Faddis, but this weekend the star is Clark Terry, one of the great soloists in jazz; other musicians this week include Roy Hargrove, James Moody, Slide Hampton, Benny Green and the singer Roberta Gambarini. Sets through Sunday are at 8 and 10:30 p.m.; cover charge is $35 at the tables, $20 at the bar and there is a $5 minimum.   RATLIFF    * DIZZY GILLESPIE FESTIVAL, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, Manhattan, (212) 258-9595. Jazz at Lincoln Center's new nightclub is opening with two weeks celebrating Dizzy Gillespie. The first week centers on Gillespie's small-band music, including his great bop landmarks of the 40's, and it features Bill Charlap's trio, with the alto saxophonist Charles McPherson and the trumpeter Nicholas Payton as guests. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11 p.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $35 with a $10 minimum at the tables and a $5 minimum at the bar.   RATLIFF    * JIM HALL/GEOFF KEEZER, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. A weekend of duos by the guitarist Jim Hall -- a patient, honest musician and a fascinating improviser -- with the pianist Geoff Keezer. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.   RATLIFF    * FRED HERSCH DUOS, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. If the jazz pianist Fred Hersch is a superb solo performer, that encomium can stretch to his duo performances, in which he both accompanies and makes a lot of his own rapturous, harmony-rich, dynamically calibrated sound-world as well. It's the end of a week at the Jazz Standard -- reprising a successful experiment at the club last year -- in which a different duo partner is featured each night. Tonight Mr. Hersch performs with the bassist John Patitucci, tomorrow with the singer Nancy King and Sunday night with the tenor saxophonist Joel Frahm. Sets through Sunday are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $25, and $20 on Sunday.   RATLIFF    * DAVE HOLLAND QUINTET, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. It's unmistakable when a band hits its stride, and the bassist Dave Holland's quintet arrived at that point in the late 90's. The music seems to play itself: dynamically controlled, light and built of sleek lines from the horns in front (Chris Potter on saxophones and Robin Eubanks on trombone), which come together and then fork off into elegant counterpoint. And it is settled by the leader's strong, thick bass lines, in vamps that repeat and repeat until it's time for solos that virtuosically make their case. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $40 and there is a $10 minimum.   RATLIFF    ARTURO O'FARRILL, BAM Cafe, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100. Mr. O'Farrill, son of the composer and arranger Chico O'Farrill, came into his father's band through the piano chair and now, since the father's death, has become its boss; more recently he became leader of Lincoln Center's impressive new Afro-Latin Jazz Orchestra. He is as conceptually invested in Afro-Cuban jazz as his father was, but in his own band he gets the jolt of the new by collaborating with the great younger players of the music. Tonight at 9:30; minimum is $10.   RATLIFF    * DIANNE REEVES AND FREDDY COLE, Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 60th Street, (212) 721-6500. Jazz singers these days seem more likely to find their information more in the restraint and mystery of bossa nova than in the unapologetic splendor of, say, Sarah Vaughan. Maybe it's because they feel that reticent music implies modernity more quickly. If so, Dianne Reeves is their opposite: she's only lightly concerned with reticence. She has an enormous (and Vaughan-inspired) voice, and an enormous talent, and she offers it up to stun her audience. Freddy Cole is the brother of Nat (King) Cole, but they sound more like cousins: though the quick-reflex delivery is there in the voice, Freddy has a richer, wider tone. He is one of the better ballad singers in jazz. Tomorrow at 8 p.m.; tickets are $30 to $150.   RATLIFF    * VISION CLUB: JOHN ZORN, ROB BROWN, ROY CAMPBELL, HENRY GRIMES, ET. AL., Brunstein Showroom, 13 Stanton Street between Chrystie and Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681. It's the first night of what will become a weekly occurrence: a group of musicians in New York's free-jazz community gathered together at this new Lower East Side spot to improvise together in varying formations. Tonight at 8 and 10; admission is $15.   RATLIFF    * STEVE WILSON QUARTET, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Steve Wilson, the saxophonist, has been in demand all over the jazz world since the 90's; everybody wants his light sound and his total assimilation of postwar saxophone history, from Parker to Coleman. He brings a band this weekend that includes the pianists Helen Sung (tonight) and Bruce Barth (tomorrow) as well as the bassist Richie Goods and the drummer Adam Cruz. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 8, 10 and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum.   RATLIFF    Cabaret    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show. Full reviews of recent cabaret shows: nytimes.com/music.    * KAREN AKERS, Le Jazz au Bar, 41 East 58th Street, (212) 308-9455. Ms. Akers brings back ''Time After Time,'' her acclaimed salute to the traditional love song. Demure and statuesque with an air of aristocratic reserve, she retains the formality of a concert performer while delivering beautifully intoned, deeply felt versions of standards that include ''I'm Old Fashioned,'' ''Falling in Love With Love.'' ''Time After Time,'' and ''Loving You.'' It is as romantically satisfying a cabaret show as you'll ever find. Don Rebic accompanies on piano. Tonight through Sunday night at 8, with a late show tomorrow night at 10:30. Cover $50 tonight and tomorrow night, $35 on Sunday; no minimum.   STEPHEN HOLDEN    BARBARA CARROLL, Oak Room, Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 419-9331. The Lady of a Thousand Songs is back in the Oak Room for Sunday brunch and evening performances. This elegant, red-headed pianist and singer is a poised entertainer whose impeccable pianism belongs to the school of jazz that maintains a sense of classical decorum at the keyboard. Even when swinging out, she remains an impressionist with special affinities for Thelonious Monk and bossa nova. Vocally, she belongs to the conversational tradition of Mabel Mercer with a style that's blasé but never cold. Sunday at 2 and 8 p.m. Cover: $55 at 2, including brunch at noon; $80 at 8, with dinner served at 6:30.   HOLDEN    CY COLEMAN, Feinstein's at the Regency, 540 Park Avenue, at 61st Street, (212) 339-4095. At 75, the Count Basie of cocktail jazz piano still commands the keyboard with the authority of a sharpshooter who never misses. He is served exceptionally well by the other members of his trio, the bassist Gary Haase and the drummer Buddy Williams. But his singing is shaky. The bulk of the show is an anecdote-laced retrospective of Mr. Coleman's show tunes sung by the composer in a gruff, frayed, occasionally tuneless voice. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30 and 11. Cover: $60; $40 minimum at the early shows and $30 at the late shows.   HOLDEN    BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, (212) 570-7189. After announcing his semi-retirement last year from performing at the Cafe Carlyle, this legendary singer and pianist changed his mind and is back in action for another season. Mr. Short never fails to conjure ebullient party spirits and has impeccable taste in songs. Expect to hear at one least one of his three signature songs, ''Guess Who's in Town?,'' ''Just One of Those Things'' and ''Romance in the Dark,'' along with something by one of the two Dukes (Ellington and Vernon). Tonight and tomorrow night 8:45 and 10:45. Cover: $90.   HOLDEN    Classical    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy opera and classical music events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent classical music and opera performances: nytimes.com/music.    Opera    'AIDA' The Metropolitan Opera often succeeds in making a spectacle of itself; at least the spectacle is warranted in the case of Verdi's ''Aida,'' originally conceived as grand opera. Everyone involved in the current revival can at least succeed in making the thing fly, led by Dolora Zajick as Amneris, whose ringing mezzo sometimes threatens to blow everyone else offstage, and Marcello Viotti in the pit, trying to keep the other principals in line. Fiorenza Cedolins is not up to the title role, except when she can sing quietly, but at least looks pretty; Franco Farina as Radamès has a robust tenor but a hint of a buzz-saw quality in the upper register. Add a few armies of dancers and a couple of braces of horses and you could have a fine old time. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $40 to $215.   ANNE MIDGETTE    'LA BOHÈME' It has been some time since the Metropolitan Opera's crowd-pleasing production of Puccini's ''Bohème'' has held much interest for adventurous opera buffs. But this revival offers an impressive and intriguing cast. The golden-voiced coloratura soprano Ruth Anne Swenson continues her exploration of the rich lyric-soprano repertory as she sings the role of Mimi. The elegant soprano Ainhoa Arteta will be Musetta. The impassioned tenor Marcelo Álvarez sings Rodolfo, and the young Swedish baritone Peter Mattei, who was such a charismatic Don Giovanni last season, appears as Marcello. Daniel Oren conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $200.   ANTHONY TOMMASINI    'CARMEN' Over the years, Bizet's gritty opéra-comique has succumbed to edema, and Franco Zeffirelli's Metropolitan Opera production suffers especially from bloat and stiffness, dealing in archetypes rather than living, breathing figures. Some new singers have stepped into the lead roles of this revival: Maria Domashenko takes on Carmen; Fabio Armiliato sings Don José; Maureen O'Flynn is Micaëla; and the stentorian bass-baritone Louis Otey is Escamillo. An additional tenor will be present in the pit: Plácido Domingo, tending his second (or is it third) career as a conductor. Tomorrow afternoon at 1:30, Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000. Remaining tickets: $215.   MIDGETTE    'LE NOZZE DI FIGARO' This great collaboration between Mozart and Lorenzo da Ponte has everything: comic scenes that demand clockwork pacing, spectacularly beautiful vocal and orchestral writing, a durable political undercurrent, thanks to the Beaumarchais play on which it is based, and most crucially, some truly moving lessons about love, betrayal and forgiveness. John Copley's lovely production has been in the New York City Opera repertory since 1977, but it has worn well, partly because the soft-hued sets and costumes by Carl Toms never get in the way of the music, and Albert Sherman's stage direction strikes a fine balance between solo turns and ensemble acting. The cast this season includes David Pittsinger as Figaro; Sharon Rostorf-Zamir as Susanna (in her house debut); Jennifer Rivera as Cherubino; Paulo Szot as the Count, and Orla Boylan as the Countess. Steven Mosteller conducts. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 1:30 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $27 to $105 tonight; $32 to $115 on Sunday.   ALLAN KOZINN    'LA TRAVIATA' Verdi's drama is so well written that a singer who can manage to get through the difficult title role is virtually guaranteed a success. At City Opera, Maria Kanyova attacks Violetta with a will and negotiates the role's hurdles with a kind of fierce vivacity, down to a brief but solid high E flat at the end of ''Sempre libera'' in Act I. Since the start of this revival in September, she has been joined by some new men in her life: Grant Youngblood, who should be a fine strong Germont, and Eric Fennell as Alfredo. Ari Pelto, a young conductor in his first appearances with the company, conducts. Tomorrow night at 8, New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 870-5570. Tickets: $32 to $115.   MIDGETTE    Classical Music    BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. Tonight, the German cellist Peter Bruns and the pianist Christoph Berner complete their two-part survey of Beethoven's music for cello and piano, including the seldom-performed variations on a theme from Mozart's ''Magic Flute.'' Tomorrow and Sunday, the violinist Mark Peskanov joins them for Beethoven's ''Ghost'' Trio and Schubert's magnificent B-flat major trio. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $20.   JEREMY EICHLER    CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER In its further pursuit of the European tradition, the Chamber Music Society heads east this weekend. Dvorak, master of Czech nationalism and every music lover's friend, takes up two-thirds of the program. The beloved Opus 81 Piano Quintet is one item, the lesser-known Opus 77 String Quintet, the other. Alexander Tcherepnin, a Russian cosmopolitan and busy composer, led a musical life on the fringes of a 20th-century music establishment dominated by Stravinsky and others, but his Cello Sonata in D will get a rare chance at the beginning of this program. Edgar Meyer is the bassist and Anne-Marie McDermott the pianist in an ensemble of players all of whom will be familiar to Chamber Music Society fans. Tonight at 8 and Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788. Tickets: $27.50 to $48.   BERNARD HOLLAND    GEWANDHAUS ORCHESTRA OF LEIPZIG This orchestra, which traces its history to 1743, gave the world's first complete traversals of the Beethoven, Brahms and Bruckner symphonies and lists Felix Mendelssohn, Arthur Nikisch, Wilhelm Furtwängler and Kurt Masur among its past music directors. Herbert Blomstedt, who became the orchestra's 18th director in 1998, is an insightful musician whose appproach should suit the all-Brahms programs he is leading on his current American tour with the orchestra. Yet concerts earlier this week at Avery Fisher Hall were puzzlingly inconsistent. Maybe it was an off night, or two. Now he heads across the Hudson to lead the Second Symphony and, with Garrick Ohlsson as his soloist, the First Piano Concerto. Tonight at 8, New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $15 to $69.   KOZINN    GUARNERI STRING QUARTET This recital of works by Beethoven, Dohnanyi and Dvorak opens the 105th season of the Peoples' Symphony Concerts, an important series that presents both young and established performers at remarkably affordable prices. As ensembles go, it doesn't get more established than the Guarneri Quartet, which was founded 40 years ago and still has three of its original members. The group also retains much of its trademark interpretative elegance in standard repertory, though when heard last weekend at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, there were occasional lapses in tuning and ensemble control. One has to admire the group's storied past, but it also makes one wish for more joyfulness or passion in its music-making of the present. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Washington Irving High School, 40 Irving Place, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680. Tickets: $9.   EICHLER    CHRISTINA KISS The line between bravery and foolhardiness may be a thin one, and undertaking to perform the complete solo piano works of Liszt -- from memory -- in several dozen recitals might easily fall on either side. Christina Kiss, a pianist who was born in Budapest and has won prizes at several international competitions, undertook this project in 1990 and has so far made it through about 550 works, leaving enough to keep her busy, she estimates, through 2015 (a decade beyond her original projection). Ms. Kiss has not listed a program for her recital tomorrow but at this point, more than 30 installments into the series, it scarcely matters. More to the point, Ms. Kiss has the bravura technique and the imagination to make this mammoth project work, and if you're a Liszt fancier, this is clearly the place to be. Tomorrow afternoon at 2, Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $35 to $45.   KOZINN    LUXEMBOURG PHILHARMONIC Bramwell Tovey, this orchestra's British music director, has begun to make headway in America, notably in a series of summertime concerts with the New York Philharmonic a few months ago. The orchestra is making its New York debut, but you can sample its wares beforehand in a new recording of works by Albert Roussel on the Timpani label. And the great added attraction is the percussionist Evelyn Glennie, playing vibraphone in a transcription of a Vivaldi concerto and marimba in the New York premiere of Bright Sheng's ''Colors of Crimson.'' Mr. Bramwell also leads the orchestra in Berlioz's ''Roman Carnival'' and Elgar's ''Enigma Variations.'' Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $30 to $65.   JAMES R. OESTREICH    * 'MUSIC FOR NEW YORK NOW' Marathon performances take on their own momentum. At the 10-hour piano extravaganza inaugurating a new performance space at the Faust Harrison Pianos showroom on Sunday, that momentum may be the main connecting thread in a deliberately eclectic narrative. The music is by composers from Chopin to Cage, classical to jazz; the 20-odd performers include leading lights of the contemporary scene like Margaret Leng Tan and Kathleen Supové; even the instruments are varied, with pianos described as ranging from ''rare vintage'' to contemporary. Conceived and curated by Jed Distler and Michael Harrison, both composers and pianists whose own works will be performed, the marathon is offered free of charge to the public, so that one's own comings and goings form the parameters of an individual's experience of the event. Sunday from noon to 10 p.m., Faust Harrison Pianos, 205 West 58th Street, Manhattan, (212) 489-0666.   MIDGETTE    NEW YORK VIRTUOSO SINGERS A chamber chorus with the word virtuoso in its name might seem over-confident, but the New York Virtuoso Singers can claim truth in advertising. Founded in 1988 by Harold Rosenbaum, the ensemble has won consistent praise for its technically accomplished and authoritative performances of a wide-range of challenging 20th-century and contemporary music. Mr. Rosenbaum is not just an expert music director but a bracing programmer. On Sunday his ensemble offers a typically adventurous program titled ''American Gems,'' with works by Crumb, Tsontakis, Zaimont, Mayer, Pellegrini and Chuaqui. At 4 p.m., Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (212) 288-8920. Suggested donation: $10; $8 for students and 65+.     TOMMASINI    ORPHEUS On its good days, this famously conductorless ensemble can play with enough precision and character to make baton-wielding maestros seem superfluous. Naturally, it also helps when the group has a strong soloist to take the lead, as it will in this concert when the formidable pianist Garrick Ohlsson performs Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 1. The ensemble is also expanding its repertory, performing two works this weekend for first time: Brahms's Haydn Variations and Sandor Veress's ''Transylvanian Dances.'' Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $30 to $88.   EICHLER     PANOCHA QUARTET Or you could argue that the headliner here is the Hungarian-born pianist Andras Schiff, in the second of a run of three appearances. (The last is a solo recital next Thursday in the Stern Auditorium at Carnegie Hall.) Here Mr. Schiff joins the Prague-based Panocha Quartet in Dvorak's Opus 81 Quintet. But the more savory Czech spices, if not the meat of the program, comes in Janacek's two quartets, the ''Kreutzer Sonata'' and ''Intimate Letters,'' as performed by masters of the style. Tonight at 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $38 to $52.   OESTREICH    CHARLES ROSEN One of the great thinkers of the keyboard world, Charles Rosen is renowned for his insightful books and essays. But his performances are by no means bookish: as concerned as he is with the details of form and style, he presents the great composers as creatures of flesh and blood, animated by passions, desires, victories and disappointments. In the second installment of his three-part series, ''The Romantic Generation'' -- the title comes from one of his books -- Mr. Rosen is exploring the peculiar world of Robert Schumann, one of Romanticism's defining spirits. Included in his program are the ''Arabeske,'' the Intermezzo from ''Faschingsschwank aus Wien,'' the Fantasy in C (Op. 17) and the richly characterized ''Davidsbündlertänze.'' Sunday at 3 p.m., with a preconcert lecture at 1:30. 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500. Tickets: $30.   KOZINN    * TOKYO STRING QUARTET With Hitler's ascent, many composers and musicians were forced to flee Europe, and we are only now beginning to understand how the modernist project was transported and transformed in their flight. With this concert, the Tokyo String Quartet begins a promising series at the 92nd Street Y, exploring the music of three exiled composers: Zemlinksy, Schoenberg and Hanns Eisler. Works by the latter two make up the heart of this program, including Eisler's little-known but wonderful String Quartet, as well as ''Verklärte Nacht,'' Schoenberg's feverishly beautiful paean to the Viennese fin-de-siècle. It's tempting to say the Tokyo players are watering down their conceit since the Schoenberg was not written in exile, and Haydn is also on the bill, but with music of this caliber performed by a top-tier ensemble, who would really complain? Tomorrow night at 8, 92nd Street Y, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500. Tickets: $35.   EICHLER    Dance    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region. * denotes a highly recommended event. Full reviews of recent dance performances:  nytimes.com/dance.    AMERICAN BALLET THEATER The company's autumn season, which continues through Nov. 7, features a rich assortment of one-act works ideally suited for a space in which dramatic details come into vivid focus. Among this weekend's highlights are two new works to be shown tonight: Trey McIntyre's ''Pretty Good Year,'' a group piece (repeated tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon), and Christopher Wheeldon's ''VIII,'' a ballet about Henry VIII with Angel Corella as the amorous monarch (to be repeated later in the season). And there are amorous duelings in Jiri Kylian's ''Petite Mort.'' Tonight at 8, tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m. City Center, West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212. Tickets: $35 to $80. (Related review, Page 3.)   JACK ANDERSON    ARTUS/COMPANY GÁBOR GODA This leading Hungarian dance and theater company will perform ''Cain's Hat,'' which explores the biblical stories of Cain and Moses. Artus, founded and directed by Gábor Goda, is known for its mix of concept, acrobatic movement and visual effects. Here, the performers perch on poles, collide in mid-air and pile stones. (For this they slaved at the ballet barre?) Today at noon and 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 8 p.m. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11. Tickets: $20; $16 for students; $10 for noon performance.   JENNIFER DUNNING    * MONICA BILL BARNES Ms. Barnes has the kind of humor -- not a snicker in sight -- that is in woefully short supply in dance these days. ''The Happy Dance (or what started out O.K.)'' sounds like a perfect example. In the tragicomic exploration of hopelessness, two twinlike characters become obsessed with a dreary, fast-paced jig that will not let go of them. Ms. Barnes describes it all as post-modern dance and musical theater with a Brechtian spin. Tonight through Sunday at 8:30 p.m. Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.   DUNNING    IAN SPENCER BELL DANCE CIRCLE This weekend's wildcard program is the work of a man, Mr. Bell, who has defined his choreographic interest as being ''in the space above our heads and beyond our grasp.'' His new ''Looking at the Stars'' is set to the music of the Platters. ''Laundry'' will be danced to music by Arlo Guthrie. A reception follows each performance. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Williamsburg Arts neXus, 205 North Seventh Street, between Driggs and Roebling Streets, Brooklyn, (718) 599-7997. Tickets: $12.   DUNNING    AKIM FUNK BUDDHA How to resist an artist who taught himself to stand still without blinking, tell stories, rap, tap and perform Mongolian throat singing? Mr. Buddha, who was born in Syracuse and raised in Zimbabwe, describes his ''Up in the Air'' as cosmic cabaret. It also features belly dancing by Pure and music by Mr. Kite. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30. BRIC Studio, 57 Rockwell Place, between Fulton Street and DeKalb Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 855-7882, x53. Tickets: $10; $8 for students.   DUNNING    * CHARLES DENNIS: 'HOMECOMING' This new documentary celebrates 20 years of dance and ultimate funk at P.S. 122, which Mr. Dennis co-founded. The film focuses on 10 choreographers who created seminal work there, with music by John Zorn, photography by Dona Ann McAdams and commentary by critics and presenters. Sunday (and Sundays through Nov. 14) at 2 p.m. P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 477-5288. Tickets: $5.   DUNNING    'FOREVER TANGO' Better than Viagra, and for all ages, too. Luis Bravo's ''Forever Tango'' features sultry and comical dancers and first-rate musicians in a show, extended through Nov. 28, that is both tacky and transcendent. Tonight (and Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays) at 8; tomorrow (and Wednesdays) at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tickets: $45 to $85.   DUNNING    FOURTHDIMENSIONDANCETHEATER Performers from De La Guarda, Momix and Stomp will join Karen Fuhrman and Dustin Stephens in their new ''Hymenoptera: The Social Order,'' danced to music by John Oyzon and Eric Lee of Groove Collective. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 7 and 9:30 p.m. John Ryan Theater at White Wave, 25 Jay Street, at John Street and the waterfront, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (917) 447-6285. Tickets: $16 to $25.   DUNNING    KDNY Strictly speaking, this program combines the work of the New York-based KDNY company and of KDHDC of Austin, Tex. They will perform, respectively, modern-dance works dances by Kathleen Dyer and Kathy Dunn Hamrick. Now you know. Tonight at 9; tomorrow at 8 p.m. Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street at Washington Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $15; $10 for students, 65+ and dancers.   DUNNING    ALI KENNER Ms. Kenner, whose mentor is Phyllis Lamhut, takes on the mathematical notion of absolute value in her new eveninglong dance of the same name. Set to music by Morgan Packard, the piece is a series of vignettes exploring the inevitabilities of attraction and habit. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. Joyce SoHo, 155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets, (212) 334-7479. Tickets: $15.   DUNNING    * KOOSIL-JA In her new mixed-media ''deadmandancing EXCESS,'' the choreographer formerly known as Kumiko Kimoto examines the fear and fantasy of dying. The set includes dozens of television monitors and the media includes film, specifically clips from movie death scenes. It all sounds pretty grim, but the Bessie Award-winning choreographer often offers new perspectives on the great themes. Tonight and tomorrow night (and Thursday through next Saturday) at 9. Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 375-0186. Tickets: $15.   DUNNING    MANDANCE PROJECT Eliot Feld's new choreographic endeavor brings together five men (Damian Woetzel, Wu-Kang Chen, Nickemil Concepcion, Jason Jordan and Sean Suozzi) and one woman (Patricia Tuthill) in solos, duets and group works by Mr. Feld to music ranging from Bach to jug band tunes. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; Sunday at 3 p.m. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800. Tickets: $42.   ANDERSON    * MERIÁN SOTO DANCE & PERFORMANCE Ms. Soto's new ''Máquina del Tiempo'' (''Time Machine'') is a full-evening piece in three parts that explores popular dance and music forms as ''time machines,'' which reveal much about their eras. The multi-media piece draws on postmodern dance and improvisational salsa, hip-hop, swing and mambo. Tonight through Sunday (and Thursday through next Sunday) at 7:30 p.m. Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Manhattan, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $25.   DUNNING    'MOUNTAIN VIEW ESTATES' Kourtney Rutherford of Big Dance Theater fame has set a murder in a house being built onstage. It all takes place in a residential tract in the shadow of a brooding volcanic Mount Rainier in Washington State in this eveninglong theater and dance piece, which examines the violence that lurks beneath everyday surfaces. Tonight and tomorrow night (and next Friday and Saturday) at 8 and 10. DUMBO Stable, 16 Main Street at Water Street, Brooklyn, (212) 420-7252. Tickets: $15.   DUNNING    NEXT WAVE FESTIVAL: BANGARRA Australia's Bangarra Dance Theater, which brings age-old Aboriginal traditions to contemporary choreographic life, returns to New York with ''Bush,'' a lush celebration of creation stories from the region known as Arnhem Land. Choreographic vignettes by Stephen Page and Frances Rings include rituals honoring female sexuality. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30. BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4129. Tickets: $20 to $45.   ANDERSON    ANN ROBIDEAUX AND ALEXANDRA SHILLING Ms. Robideaux and Ms. Shilling choreograph offbeat dance as well as teaching at the American Dance Festival. Their new ''Sun Shines Over the Yardarm'' sounds like a similar mix of tradition and the new. The new site-specific dance piece will be performed aboard the historic lightship Frying Pan, as an interactive tour that combines dance, history and sound. Tomorrow at 1, 2 and 3 p.m. The Frying Pan, Pier 63, 23rd Street and West Side Highway, Chelsea, (646) 321-9383. Tickets: $15 (by reservation, which is recommended); $20 day of show.   DUNNING    * STREB S.L.A.M. You could say Elizabeth Streb and her performers are sitting pretty, with their own 150-seat studio-theater in which to create new work and regularly present it. But no one sits for long at a Streb program. The dancers fly, dive and dangle in new and recent pieces. The audience can walk around, as at a fairground, with popcorn provided. Tonight and tomorrow night (and Fridays and Saturdays through Nov. 20) at 7.; Sunday (and Sundays through Nov. 21) at 3 p.m. S.L.A.M. (Streb Lab for Action Mechanics), 51 North First Street, Willliamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 384-6481. Tickets: $15.   DUNNING    * WORLD MUSIC INSTITUTE: MASKED RITUALS OF KERALA, INDIA In these ancient masked rituals (theyyams), men in sumptuous jeweled costumes and headdresses are transformed into gods and goddesses, shifting consciousness on stage from the mundane to the divine. Martial arts figure in dances (vellattam) for warrior gods. Sunday at 3 and 8 p.m. Symphony Space, Broadway at 95th Street, (212) 545-7536. Tickets: $30; $15, children.

Broadway    + 'DRACULA, THE MUSICAL' And here it is, looming like a giant stuffed bat on a stick, the easiest target on Broadway. This show, which sets the familiar tale of old snaggletooth to the familiar music of Frank Wildhorn, bristles with all the animation, suspense and sex appeal of a Victorian waxworks in a seaside amusement park. Take your shots. Say something, if you must, about toothlessness or bloodlessness or the kindness of hammering stakes into the hearts of undead shows. But you may concede that it isn't much fun to trash something so eminently trashable. ''Dracula, the Musical,'' which features a book and lyrics by Don Black and Christopher Hampton and is directed by Des McAnuff (''The Who's Tommy''), isn't simply bad, which is an aesthetic state of being that is kind of fun if you're in the right mood. It is bad and boring. Among the talents wasted here are Melissa Errico, Kelli O'Hara, Stephen McKinley Henderson and, looking like a butler's butler in the title role, Tom Hewitt (2:10). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6000. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $101.25.   BEN BRANTLEY     *+ 'I AM MY OWN WIFE' (Tony winner for best play and best actor in a play). Doug Wright's one-actor play, with a thrillingly accomplished performance by Jefferson Mays and a diamond-sharp production directed by Moisés Kaufman, tells a terrific story based on a real person, Charlotte von Mahlsdorf (né Lothar Berfelde), a soft-spoken but tenaciously gender-bending biological man who died in 2002 at 74. Her lifelong obsession -- Mahlsdorf preferred to be thought of as female -- was the preservation of furniture, especially from the 1890's, and other household relics like Victrolas and gramophones. Her devotion to her astonishing collection, with which she turned her home into a museum, gave focus and motivation to a life whose grandest achievement was that it proceeded to its natural end. The play is largely about Charlotte's enduring the cruel repressions of the Nazis and the Communists, and her harrowing tales of survival through the eras of the Gestapo and the Stasi are nothing short of breathtaking. Ah, but are they credible? That also becomes an issue in the play, which very subtly but, in the end, quite powerfully makes a case for the necessity of storytelling in our lives (2:15). Lyceum, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $86.25, with $20 student and teacher tickets at the box office the day of show.   BRUCE WEBER    * 'RECKLESS' The most dangerous smile on Broadway fills the opening moments of this animated revival of Craig Lucas's comedy from 1988, directed by Mark Brokaw. The smile belongs to Mary-Louise Parker, playing an improbably ecstatic houswife on Christmas Eve, and it's enough to make anyone grin back at her. In the course of the show, however, Ms. Parker's smile wavers, tightens and shrinks in ways that seem to age her at least a decade, so that by the end, you may feel like you've undergone high-speed Prozac withdrawal. ''Reckless'' milks the tension between a goofy surface intoxication and a core of cold sobriety. The story of a runaway waif-woman in a violent world, ''Reckless'' remains a beguiling sneaky crash course in the loss of innocence. Granted, it's as thick with whimsy as Pee-wee Herman's playhouse, and its ideal environment is not a big Broadway theater. But Ms. Parker's high incandescence and emotional fluidity go some distance in justifying this scaled-up production (1:45). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $51-$79; $26 student rush tickets available the day of the show.   BRANTLEY    *+ 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure on stage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naïf of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Hirschfeld, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101.   BRANTLEY    Off Broadway     + 'DIRTY TRICKS' Distinguishing between blazing energy and plain old desperation isn't always easy. Look at Martha Mitchell, who as the wife of United States Attorney General John Mitchell teetered so spectacularly between high spirits and dementia during the Watergate era. Now in John Jeter's ''Dirty Tricks,'' the redoubtable Judith Ivey has taken on the woman whose eagerness to share secrets and fears with the American people helped bring down the presidency of Richard Nixon. Ms. Ivey, as always, has vitality and skill to spare. But these assets are deployed in a vain attempt to paper over the seams in a conspicuously piecemeal play. Like its compulsively chatty heroine, ''Dirty Tricks,'' directed by Margaret Whitton, is scattershot, hazy and, yes, desperate. Even with Ms. Ivey pouring on the cotillion-belle flirtiness and Southern discomfort, ''Dirty Tricks'' is nowhere near as entertaining or alarming as Mrs. Mitchell was at the height of her notoriety (1:30). Public Theater, 525 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50.   BRANTLEY    * 'MRS. FARNSWORTH' Political candidates poised to sling mud might take a pointer from A. R. Gurney: good manners can be lethal weapons. Though it deals with revelations that are the stuff of smear campaigns, ''Mrs. Farnsworth'' is as polite and sweetly subversive a political attack as you're likely to come across. Set in a creative-writing classroom (with the excellent Danny Burstein as the teacher), the play unfolds around its title character's desire to write a novel about her youthful involvement with a man who sounds awfully like George W. Bush. Sigourney Weaver, returning to the role she created last spring, deploys annihilating charm as a wealthy high-WASP wife; Gerry Bamman, as her husband, completes the cast. ''Mrs. Farnsworth,'' directed by Jim Simpson, is a polemical exercise that never screams at you. Instead, it feels as if it is spoken out of the side of the mouth -- sotto voce and through a locked jaw. As delivered by Ms. Weaver, this turns out be a thoroughly disarming technique (1:30). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $60.   BRANTLEY    + 'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A giggle of clowns led by the Russian master Slava Polunin is stirring up laughter and enjoyment at the Union Square Theater. As audiences shuffle in through the snowlike rectangles of white paper that blanket the floor and seats, prompting immediate attempts at artificial snowball throwing, this show announces itself as something unusual. And so it is, as Mr. Polunin, with his baggy yellow romperlike costume, his red ball of a nose, his tufts of white hair and his shaggy red bulbous shoes, teams with his cutup colleagues. Before the night is over, in a show that touches the heart as well as tickles the funnybone, members of the audience are likely to find themselves covered by a giant cobweb, spritzed with water, providing a lap for a wandering clown and stung by the snow of the title, propelled with blizzard force in a dramatic finale (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 5:30 p.m. Tickets $59.90 to $64.90.   LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    'SPATTER PATTERN (OR HOW I GOT THAT STORY)' Neal Bell's moody new play is a cautionary tale that proves the wisdom of avoiding one's neighbors. Edward Dunn (Peter Frechette), one of the dual protagonists, is a screenwriter still in shellshock over the death of his companion of more than two decades. Trying to jumpstart his stalled career, he moves into a pokey new studio apartment. His neighbor who turns out to be -- egad! -- a tabloid star, the Prof Who Offed the Co-ed, although the guilt of Marcus Tate (Darren Pettie) has yet to be proved. (He hasn't even been charged.) Edward, at emotional loose ends, strikes up a casual friendship with the celebrity next door. They are soon embroiled in a knotty psychological intimacy. Elements of Mr. Bell's murder-mystery plot suggest the playwright has logged more than a few ''Law & Order'' marathons in his television-watching diary. But the writing has a literate, high-toned shimmer that would probably bring out the red pencils from Dick Wolf's producers. Unfortunately the playwright is unable to meld these elements into a satisfying whole. The play rings hollow as an inquiry into gray areas of moral responsibility. And ''Spatter Pattern'' fizzles out more thoroughly as a thriller with an unexciting conclusion. But the director Michael Greif's stylish production drenches the writing in so much noir-ish atmosphere it takes a while to notice. Mr. Frechette's familiar, woozy-wistful stage persona is a good match for the emotionally dislocated Edward, and the opaque surfaces of Mr. Pettie's Marcus Tate keep us guessing (2:00). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $38 to $45.   CHARLES ISHERWOOD    + 'STRING OF PEARLS' It's that old one-object-through-the-years gimmick, but Michele Lowe's one-act drama makes it fresh, funny and poignant. The stellar four-woman cast includes Ellen McLaughlin, the Tony Award-winning angel from ''Angels in America,'' and Mary Testa, the Tony-nominated alcoholic voice teacher from ''On the Town.'' Along with Antoinette LaVecchia and Sharon Washington, they create more than two dozen characters in a highly satisfying, often hilarious blend of sex, satire and absurdism, with an emphasis on women's relationships and the inevitability of both loss and happiness. The play, directed with knowing sparkle by Eric Simonson, is the tale of a necklace bought by a New York man for his wife just before he dies, its loss and its travels over the next three decades. That involves a lot of women, including a divorced landlady who is kind to a woman with cancer, a Tunisian hotel housekeeper with a greedy husband, a Riverside Drive swimmer who pretends not to be rich and a 300-pound lesbian gravedigger. Even the minor characters are memorable (1:30). Primary Stages at 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55.   ANITA GATES    ++ 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudités. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed as if it were a traffic jam by David Schweizer, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. (''She may not want a Scotch, Brandon. It's not dark yet, and she's only half-WASP.'') But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away. With Lynn Whitfield and Reg E. Cathey as the transformed spouses and the inimitable Julie Halston, who finds the wildly surreal in the conventional role of a blue-blooded snob (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.   BRANTLEY    Last Chance    * 'HEDDA GABLER' Ivo van Hove's strange, and strangely enthralling, new production of Ibsen's much-mounted drama about a dangerously frustrated housewife may not necessarily illuminate the play as a dramatic text. His sights are set considerably higher: he is an artist seeking, as Ibsen once did, to illuminate the world around him. The set, designed by his longtime collaborator Jan Versweyveld, is not a reasonable representation of the handsome, expensively appointed home spoken of more than once in the course of the play; the empty, echoing space represents an interior landscape, the cold, underpopulated expanses of Hedda's mind. In a performance that is a major achievement for this adventurous actress, Elizabeth Marvel evokes this process with captivating clarity, tracing the disjointed trajectory of an intellect devouring itself. The rest of the cast is also superb (2:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.   ISHERWOOD    'LAST EASTER' The unofficial anthem of Bryony Lavery's abrasively sentimental comedy is Irving Berlin's ''Easter Parade.'' But as you watch this tale of a terminally ill lighting designer and her terminally madcap friends, you may think of another Berlin standard, the one in which theater folk are hymned for being able ''to smile when they are low.'' The author, who made a smashing New York debut this year with ''Frozen,'' chronicles an antic trip to Lourdes undertaken by June (Veanne Cox), a lighting designer with second-stage cancer, and her three best friends. They all face down doom with the typically British stiff upper lip, though here it acquires a curl of flashy bravado. The attitude is adorned with bright, shrink-wrapped eccentricities and desperate jokes. Directed by Doug Hughes, the cast members are as winsomely brittle as the script demands that they be. But the pained, reflective lyricism at the play's center is overwhelmed by its brave, quippy flippancy (2:00). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 279-4200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2:30 and 8 p.m.. Tickets: $60; $15 student rush tickets available 30 minutes before performances.   BRANTLEY    'RICHARD III' Ascending the throne has never been more of a struggle for Shakespeare's most Machiavellian monarch than it is in this production. Peter Dinklage (of the film ''The Station Agent''), who portrays the title character, is 4 foot 5 inches, and the throne of England was obviously designed with a taller man in mind. That means that for this Richard, physically placing himself in the seat of power requires strenuous and gymnastic exertions, an image that would be comic except for the determination and harsh sense of absurdity with which he invests it. And once this Richard is seated, he owns that throne. The hard blue ice of his eyes is enough to deflect any challenge. It is even almost enough to make you forget the overheated amateurishness of the show. Peter DuBois's production doesn't drag, but its high spirits are those of an overcaffeinated adolescent. See it, though, for Mr. Dinklage's refreshingly direct and purposeful Richard, whose fierce, effortful will power translates into extraordinary charisma (2:45). Public Theater, 525 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.;Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50.   BRANTLEY    Art    A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend.

Museums    * 'THE ART OF ROMARE BEARDEN,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Ave., at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Jan. 9. It's a pity only that this retrospective is so big. Art like Bearden's -- mostly small, intense and intricate -- deserves close scrutiny. His genius, aside from his poetic knack for piecing scraps of photographs and other tiny tidbits together, was to see collage as an inherent social metaphor: that its essence was to turn nothings into something, making disparate elements cohere, a positivist enterprise. His collages celebrated black culture and personal history, combined elements of East and West, high and low, old and new: African masks with ancient Greek art, Matisse with patchwork quilts. Literature and music shaped the work no less than Picasso, George Grosz and Vermeer did. ''There are roads out of secret places within us along which we all must move as we go to touch others,'' Bearden said. And that's exactly where he takes us. Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.   MICHAEL KIMMELMAN    'ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR,' New Museum of Contemporary Art/Chelsea, 556 West 22nd Street, (212) 219-1222, through Nov. 13. Occupying new temporary quarters on the Chelsea Art Museum's ground floor, the New Museum presents a mostly video group show that reflects the problems of adapting to the constant changes of modern experience. Robert Melee's home-entertainment center documents his adaptation to his eccentric mother; a video by Bojan Sarcevic shows a Turkish Gypsy band learning to play Western pop songs; and, best of all, a video by Kerry Tribe shows a wonderfully charismatic 10-year-old girl thoughtfully responding to philosophical questions posed by a man off-camera. Hours: Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, to 8 p.m. Admission: $6; students and 65+, $3.   KEN JOHNSON    * 'JOSEF AND ANNI ALBERS: DESIGNS FOR LIVING,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This enlightening, quietly excellent show is the first to juxtapose the design efforts -- his furniture, her textiles -- of two remarkable artists who happened to be married to each other. Instead of Josef's paintings of glowing nesting squares, which presage Minimalism, we get his 1927 nesting tables with the same meticulous sense of color, proportion and geometry that he would later apply to canvas. Anni brought a similarly intelligent structure to fabrics and tapestries that make every thread, texture and color count, at once exposing and exalting her medium's basic grid. She was the Sol LeWitt of weaving. Reflecting design moving toward art by dint of formidable concentration on its own purposes and potentials, this show may rearrange some ideas about early modernist design as well as Minimalist art and furniture. Hours: Tuesdays to Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; students and 62+, $7.   ROBERTA SMITH    * 'AUSTRIA WEST: NEW ALPINE ARCHITECTURE' AND 'NEW ALPINE RESIDENCES,' Austrian Cultural Forum, 11 East 52nd Street, (212) 319-5300, through Oct. 30. An exciting survey of more than 70 structures -- from hotels to factories -- produced by what amounts to a thriving school of young architects working in the Austrian provinces of Tyrol and Vorarlberg. Their historical pedigree reaches back to the International Style and the Bauhaus, but has been relaxed by postmodernism and inspired by recent advances in building materials, techniques and systems. Nothing helps the new Alpine architecture like the grandeur of the old Alpine landscape, but this show confirms the point so often lost on American builders: that elegance, sustainability, innovation and respect for the environment are not antithetical. A show within a show of 40 houses by the same architects reflects more intimate applications of their ideas. One can come away with the inspiring realization that old history can be taught new tricks, and that even in these global, postmodern, pluralistic times, there can still be such a thing as a coherent style that accommodates individual sensibilities. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Free.   SMITH    * 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry, and in one astonishing small sculpture, a human face splits apart to reveal the ages of man. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing.   HOLLAND COTTER    * 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China; a few were unearthed as recently as last year. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. There are a few monumental sculptures; most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small, but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. It's a show that asks you to do some work, but there is so much of interest to look at that no one, even the casual drive-by viewer, will feel shortchanged. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $12; students and 65+, $7.   COTTER    * 'COLONIAL ANDES: TAPESTRIES AND SILVERWORK, 1530-1830,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Dec. 12. This sumptuous, groundbreaking show examines the fruitful cultural collision triggered by the Spanish conquest of the highly developed Incan empire in 1532. Their forced mixing resulted in a third hybrid culture that reached its zenith in two indigenous crafts: metalwork and, especially, tapestry weaving, which the Andean people perfected over 100 years. Beginning with the gorgeously geometric pre-Colonial tunics and mantles worn by the Inca elite, this exhibition traces the progressive absorption and adjustment of Renaissance and Baroque styles from Europe. The silverwork has an astounding roiling energy that seems to reflect the metal's abundance. Hours and admission: see above.   SMITH    * 'DESIGN IS NOT ART: FUNCTIONAL OBJECTS FROM DONALD JUDD TO RACHEL WHITEREAD,' Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, through Feb. 27. This bracingly contentious but spatially challenged and cursory show is worth seeing, if only because it is the first in an American museum to survey the functional and semifunctional objects designed during the last three decades by artists, in this case 18 well-known Minimalists, post-Minimalists and post-post-Minimalists. The show is overdue, which also makes it seem late, as it ignores many younger artists. It also resembles a high-end home furnishings store. Points of interest are few: Richard Tuttle's lamps, John Chamberlain's carved foam couch, Joel Shapiro's side tables, crystal tumblers by Sol LeWitt and, above all, Franz West's decorate-it-yourself table and chairs. The only designs that seem likely to last are those of Donald Judd, who presides over the exhibition as Picasso would over a survey of Cubism. Hours and admission: see above.   SMITH    'DON'T CALL IT PERFORMANCE,' Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, through Nov. 7. Performative seems to be the preferred term now for performance art, to distinguish it from theater. Whatever, it's alive and kicking here where short videos by 30 artists, mostly Latino or Latin American but including some North American and European colleagues, are on view. They are grouped in five categories, dealing with behavior; meditative and spiritual explorations; pop culture; social and political views; and sound, including language and music. The work is uneven, but you do get a sense that a younger generation is keeping performative work a vital presence in the art world. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $6; $4 for students and 65+.   GRACE GLUECK    'EUROPEAN BRONZES FROM THE QUENTIN COLLECTION,' the Frick Collection, 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, through Jan. 2. During the last few decades there has been a revival of interest in the collection and technical exploration of small-scale bronzes from the Renaissance, depicting gods, goddesses, religious figures, nymphs, fauns, satyrs, animals and simple folk. About 35 of these statuettes, from the 15th to the mid-18th centuries and assembled by an Argentine collector, star in this lively show. Originally inspired by mythological themes or classical marble statuary, and often reconstructed in innovative ways by well-known artists, the statuettes were eagerly sought by European connoisseurs, who admired their masterly modeling, subtle surfacing and elegant finishes. Happily, these bronzes are displayed without vitrines, so they can be examined closely from every angle. Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 6 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for 62+; $5 for students.   GLUECK    'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, through Jan. 16. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. And in these portraits, mostly of upper-class offspring, to be sure, he tended to get more real. This show, presenting about 40 works on the subject, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how his likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood that came into play at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. For the most part here, he seems to see his young subjects that way, rather than as the syrupy stereotypes portrayed by his Victorian and 18th-century predecessors. Said to be the first to bring together Sargent's influential portraits of children, the show with its catalog is a refreshing new take on this bravura brushmeister. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $6; students and 62+, $3.   GLUECK    * 'LOOKING AT LIFE,' International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, through Nov. 28. From its start in 1936 until its demise as a weekly magazine in 1972, Life was this country's archive of public memory, supplying millions of Americans, most of them educated, white and middle class, with a collective visual inventory of the world as imagined for Main Street, U.S.A. This entertaining show is a reminder of many memorable photographs the magazine published, from Robert Capa's pictures of the landing at Normandy Beach and Larry Burrows's bloodied G.I.'s in Vietnam to W. Eugene Smith's Spanish village and Carlo Bavagnoli's shot of Jane Fonda as Barbarella. The big idea is how Life and, by implication, all forms of popular journalism, package news, but in the end the photographs, looked at one by one, speak for themselves. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+.     KIMMELMAN    * 'MEMORIALS OF WAR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, through Nov. 28. The Whitney reveals a little-seen aspect of its collection and some interesting new acquisitions in this small but powerful show of works inspired by the Vietnam War. Vic Muniz's recent photographs are ghostly recreations of three of that era's most indelible news photographs. Edward Kienholz and Robert Morris are represented by proposals from around 1970 for unexecuted memorials that emphasize the hard truths of armed combat. Chris Burden restages five of America's ''Darker Moments,'' in tableaus whose toy-soldier scale in no way diminishes shocks and aftershocks of these events. Hours and admission: see above.   SMITH    Galleries: Uptown    NICOLA HICKS, Flowers, 1000 Madison Avenue, (212) 439-1700, through Oct. 30. This accomplished British sculptor combines neo-Classical traditionalism, surrealistic mythology and Modernist raw materialism in bronze and painted plaster representations of humans and animals. The life-size reclining nude attended by winged putti veers toward old school academicism, but the portraits of dogs and the muscular head of a Minotaur have much vitality.   JOHNSON    STONE ROBERTS, Salander-O'Reilly, 20 East 79th Street, (212) 879-6606, through Oct. 30. Mr. Roberts aims for a kind of Victorian revivalism in his big paintings of well-to-do New Yorkers inside and outside their well-appointed homes. Apparently copied from photographs, they are made with assiduous attention to detail, and from a distance the realist illusionism is impressive if not colorful. The narrative psychology is vapid, however, and under close-up inspection, the paint is lifeless.   JOHNSON    FRITZ BULTMAN, ''Irascible II: Abstract Expressionist Paintings, Circa 1960,'' Schlesinger, 24 East 73rd Street, (212) 734-3600, through Oct. 30. In the late 1950's and early 60's, this Abstract Expressionist was in top form, judging by the eight small- to medium-size canvases in this show. He wasn't doing anything that Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline didn't do, but his impetuous, sensuously crusty paintings have an urgency of their own that still feels fresh.   JOHNSON    Galleries: 57th Street    KATHERINE BOWLING, ''Divide,'' Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, (212) 445-0444, through Oct. 30. To plain vanilla countryside, Ms. Bowling's softly brushed works bring a touch of soul. Concentrating on the landscapes surrounding her home in upstate New York, she responds to the roads, trees and fields that she experiences daily and the light that falls on them at various times of day and night. Her spirit is derived from the great landscapists of the past, but she uses thoroughly modern compositional and painting devices.   GLUECK     Galleries: SoHo     'THE ART OF READING,' Poets House, 72 Spring Street, (212) 431-7920, through Nov. 22. This appropriately quiet presentation of 38 small paintings, drawings, prints and photographs of people reading includes Paul Cadmus's portrait of Glenway Wescott; David Hockney's sweet colored pencil drawing of a young man reclining on a sofa; photographs of William Burroughs by Allen Ginsberg; and King Babar (the elephant) reading his newspaper at the beach in a watercolor by Laurent DeBrunhoff.   JOHNSON    WILLIAM HUDDERS, Tatistcheff, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-4547, through Oct. 30. If you gave this exhibition of neatly painted views of Long Island City-scapes and still-life pictures of shoes, apples and glassware just a quick glance you might peg it as the work of an earnestly conservative recent art school graduate. The more you look, however, the more inexplicably odd, sweet and subtly humorous these cannily simplified pictures seem. Influences of De Chirico and Hopper are evident, but Mr. Hudders has his own engaging way with the poetry of ordinary things.   JOHNSON    JEFF LADOUCEUR, ''Schmo,'' ZieherSmith, 531 West 25th Street, (212) 229-1088, through Nov. 13. With a finely pointed pen in black ink and a meticulous touch, this Vancouver-based artist draws cartoons about a bald, long-nosed, sad-sack of a character called ''Schmo.'' Our hero's struggles with ordinary existence and surrealistic encounters with cloud-creatures, tiny elephants, octopi and an abominable snowman are funny, weird and touching.   JOHNSON    Galleries: Chelsea     TONY DE LOS REYES, ''The Strange Tale of Near and Far,'' DCKT Contemporary, 537 West 24th Street, (212) 741-9955, through Oct. 30. From a distance it looks as if Mr. de los Reyes is in engaged in an eccentric revival of some antique tradition. He paints images of 17th-century ships at sea and detailed images of wild plants and flowers in shades of blue and white like Delftware. Up close you discover that these glossy pictures are made by distinctively modern methods of pouring, pooling and manipulating liquid paint.   JOHNSON    * NALINI MALANI, Bose Pacia, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 989-7074, through Oct. 30. Ms. Malani, based in Mumbai, has been seen here only sporadically, with paintings in museum group shows and an intensely theatrical video installation at the New Museum two years ago. Both media play a role in this strong gallery solo show, her first in Manhattan, that draws on mythology, religion and history, both Western and Indian. In paintings, she dovetails the figures of Sita from the ''Ramayana'' and Medea -- the one an ideal of submissive self-sacrifice, the other an emblem of destructive fury -- to propose a complex female persona beyond controlling stereotypes. A video installation addressing sectarian violence and a magic lantern-style shadow play complete the exhibition, which finds a political artist of impressive visual range at the height of her power.   COTTER    Other Galleries     'ELECTRIFYING ART: ATSUKO TANAKA, 1954-1968,' Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, through Dec. 11. In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Tanaka was a member of the avant-garde Japanese art group called Gutai, and the Grey Gallery survey covers the years of that association. It's a visually low-key show, but one with lots of ideas from an artist who was doing proto-Conceptualist and proto-Minimalist work and very early versions of sound and performance art. Spend time with the short films in the galleries; they bring everything else to life.   COTTER    * FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION NATIONAL MONUMENT, Foley Square, Lower Manhattan, (212) 206-6674, through Nov. 13. On a return engagement sponsored by Creative Time and the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, this interactive outdoor sculpture, made in the symbolic year 1984, consists of a big, bright red Constructivist-style megaphone, through which members of the public can exercise their right to free speech. The work is a collaboration among the architect Laurie Hawkinson, the artist Erika Rothenberg and the performer John Malpede. It points, perhaps appropriately, toward the state and federal courthouses.   SMITH    Last Chance     HERNAN BAS, ''Sometimes With One I Love,'' Daniel Reich, 537 A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949, through tomorrow. Mr. Bas, who lives in Miami and was in the 2004 Whitney Biennial, paints formally modest but unabashedly sentimental narratives of adventure, sexual intrigue and mystical experience starring slender, fine-featured adolescent boys. Made in an expressionistic style that calls to mind paperback book covers of the 1940's, his easel-size paintings are exciting mainly for the possibly more ambitious future of painterly story-telling they promise.   JOHNSON    SANG-AH CHOI, ''Ultra Immortality,'' Sandra Gering, 534 West 22nd Street, (646) 336-7183, through tomorrow. A skillful technician and inventive Neo-Pop image maker, Ms. Choi produces glossy panel paintings that use resin and reflective plastics to imitate traditional Asian lacquer work. Images lifted from fashion magazines and childishly sweet cartoons seduce while satirizing a world of infantile consumerism. Also on view are small pop-up books that are marvels of paper-cutting craft.   JOHNSON    'COVER GIRL: THE FEMALE BODY AND ISLAM IN CONTEMPORARY ART,' Ise Cultural Foundation, 555 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 925-1649, through tomorrow. Islam is a monolithic word in the West, though there is every reason to know it shouldn't be. The five women in this show were born in Islamic countries or raised in Islamic households. Yet no two of them take the same approach to the theme -- at once a stereotype and a reality -- of the veiled female body in Islamic culture. A wall text by the Indian artist Rummana Hussain, who died in 1999, captures the prevailing refusal to deal in easy answers: ''Have you defined her? Does she have any options? Are her beliefs an escape? Or a security? Or a habit? Or a choice?'' The complete text is quite long, and it is composed entirely of questions.   HOLLAND COTTER    * DONALD JUDD, Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, Soho, (212) 966-5154, through tomorrow. This show features an unknown work:the only triangular piece in captivity by the generally four-square Minimalist sculptor Donald Judd. It is large, equilateral, made of raw plywood mad open at the top, with its interior and exterior unexpectedly opposed. The only other triangular Judd is an outdoor work in concrete in Australia.   SMITH    * 'LEON FERRARI: POLITISCRIPTS,' The Drawing Room, 40 Wooster St., (212) 219-2166, through tomorrow. Born in Argentina in 1920, Leon Ferrari is one of a group of Latin American modernists who, in the 1960's, created an intensely politicized art that ran in parallel to, and sometimes anticipated, trends in Europe and North America. The ink-on-paper pieces in this small show may best be understood as a response to the repressive political of environment of Argentina in 1960's, when censorship was common. A few are inflammatory statements by the artist written in a twisting script at once amusingly ornate and next to impossible to read. And even those that look entirely abstract are executed with care, so that they all convey the impression of carrying coded and encrypted information known only to the artist. In short, they are like taunting gestures of counter-censorship. Through its very opaqueness abstraction becomes a political tool. COTTER    PETER GREAVES, ''Reverie,'' Forum, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 355-4545, through tomorrow. Mr. Greaves's miniature portraits of attractive young women, each a bit larger than a postage stamp, are marvels of fastidious technique. With a slightly hazy focus and not a single visible stroke of pencil or brush, his tiny, pensive heads seem to emerge as if conjured by sorcery from the dark backgrounds.   JOHNSON    ROBIN HILL, Lennon Weinberg, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 941-0012, through tomorrow. Second-generation Process artists don't fade away, they just keep marshalling orderly accumulations of this or that material as if Eva Hesse never existed. The works here employ cotton batting, wax, plaster and string, as well as hundreds of tiny circles of mica that are pinned to the wall in buoyant circling lines. Beautiful, but also familiar.   SMITH    TERESA HUBBARD AND ALEXANDER BIRCHLER, ''Single Wide,'' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, through today. ''Single Wide'' is a technically sophisticated, six-minute video loop that revolves around the nighttime event of a distraught woman crashing her pickup truck into her rural ''single wide''-size trailer home. Shot in one long circulating pan, it is like a film version of a Gregory Crewdson photograph with the vividly amplified sound effects of a Janet Cardiff production.   JOHNSON    AN-MY LE, Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, (212) 463-7372, through tomorrow. ''Theater of war'' refers to the geopolitical area that any war actively encompasses. But battles are staged and choreographed, troops deployed in units, like corps de ballet. All of this requires rehearsal, and rehearsal for war is the subject of these photographs, shot at the Marine Corps Air Ground Control Center in California, a desert outpost where marines train for future combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. The terrain has a John Ford-ish grandeur. The marines act out cowboy-and-Indian roles: some play Americans; others play Iraqis. The pictures are dramatic and gorgeous, as combat photography often is. They are also apt documents of a war which, some people argue, is based on a fiction and, at least as originally scripted, staged for the media.   COTTER    * BEN NICHOLSON, Jacobson Howard, 19 East 76th Street, (212) 570-2362, through tomorrow. The best pieces in this show of paintings and drawings by one of the best painters to emerge in England between the world wars are a half-dozen Cubist-style pictures from the 1940's and 50's. They are notable for their exquisite draftsmanship, suave colors, delicately tactile surfaces and lively, syncopated play with flat shapes and planar layering.   JOHNSON    PAUL HENRY RAMIREZ, ''In Fluent Form,'' Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, through tomorrow. The stylized parsings of the body in these impeccably mannered canvases are accomplished by dividing flat, pristine white grounds with arrangements of thin vertical and horizontal lines, often rooted in rounded blocks of brilliant color. The lines support bright, fleshy blobs in candy hues and occasionally end in hearts that flower into symmetrical bursts of wiry, wiglike curls. Elegant splatters of drops in the shape of eyeballs dance cheerily around these conceits. The high-finish paint surface is nothing short of perfection. The body as an 18th-century drawing room or a Vivaldi composition might work as a description of these pretty but sterile paintings.   GLUECK    * PIPILOTTI RIST, Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9100, through tomorrow. This relatively uncluttered video installation offers full-blown Rist World along with further proof that the artist's dizzying, slipping, sliding conflation of sound, color, scale and spatial illusion has few equals in video. The subversive (feminist) tensions of Ms. Rist's best works are absent here, but the work makes the brain so fuzzily relaxed you may not notice.   SMITH    'TALESPINNING: SELECTIONS FALL 2004,' Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, Soho, (212) 219-2166, through tomorrow. The work of 14 artists whose imagery flirts with narrative in one way or another fills this wide-ranging show, which exposes some intriguing talents. Some manipulate texts and even whole books; others play with fairy tales and folklore; still others base figments on literary characters and a few address social, political and other worldly topics. It all adds up to an uneven show, but one in the center's tradition of invigorating experiment.
