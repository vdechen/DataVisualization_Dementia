"JAICKS--David P., 78, a pioneer in food processing and education activist, successfully introduced new technologies to the production and distribution of food processing for an ever larger population, and, among other community actions, was a leader in the integration of local schools in the 1960s and 1970s, died Monday at a nursing home in Ridgewood, NJ. The cause was complications from Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Born in Lake Forest, IL, he entered the US Navy in 1943 at the age of 18. The Navy selected him for the V12 program for officer training. In 1945, while the war in the Pacific was still raging, he shipped out to Japan, arriving just after the second atomic bomb. His first task was to lead his men in the SEABEES in the clean-up and re-building of Nagasaki's infrastructure. After the War, Mr. Jaicks took his family to the East Coast to join American Home Products Corporation (now Wyeth) in their foods division. American Home Foods, makers of Chef-BoyAr-Dee, Gulden's Mustard, and Jiffy Pop-Corn, was just beginning to be an important company when he joined in 1964. In 1990 when he retired from the company as CEO and President of seven plants, he had introduced state of the art technology and a major R and D department run by scientists. Mr. Jaicks also led the movement to integrate both in his company and in the community. He campaigned successfully to join the Waldwick Board of Education, ultimately becoming president of the Board. Together with a small band of community activists, he canvassed door-to-door to win an election giving the community the funds to build a school. The Waldwick High School still stands as a monument to that Board. In the 1960s and the 1970s Mr. Jaicks worked tirelessly with Fair Housing and Ridgewood Association of Good Schools (RAGS) to move his new town, Ridgewood, away from de-facto segregation. He had a reputation for scrupulous fairness and for mentoring. ''He showed me that he had faith in me--he pushed me to broaden my expertise and my experiences in the company. Everyone loved him,'' Ken Martin, CFO of Wyeth Corporation, said yesterday. Not content with staying home as a retiree in the 1990s, Mr. Jaicks accepted lengthy tours of duty in Ukraine and Poland working as a volunteer for the Citizens Corps for Democracy and the International Executive Service Corps. Mr. Jaicks, who lived in Ridgewood, NJ with his wife, Nancy, is survived by her, by four sons, Bryan of Ridgewood, Andrew of Tucson, Perry of Mesa, AZ, Cameron of Vail, two stepsons, Raul Cintra-Leite of Saddle Brook, NJ and Alex Cintra-Leite of San Mateo, CA, and five grandchildren.

The survey, by the National Endowment for the Arts, also indicates that people who read for pleasure are many times more likely than those who don't to visit museums and attend musical performances, almost three times as likely to perform volunteer and charity work, and almost twice as likely to attend sporting events.

"Young love — the old-fashioned kind that flourished before the age of the hook-up — has always been one of the most challenging emotions to portray on the screen with any specificity. Beyond the smooches, sighs and adoring glances, how do you convey the reality of a shared, private paradise? In the strongest scenes of the screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's treacly best seller, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams break through the barrier to evoke high-strung, slightly crazed teenagers plunging headlong into first love. Against your better judgment, you root for them to beat the odds against them. The romantic drama, which spans six decades, is told in flashback as Duke (James Garner), a garrulous, ailing old codger in a comfortable nursing home, reads aloud excerpts of a love story to a woman (Gena Rowlands) suffering from Alzheimer's disease. As the movie seesaws between Seabrook, N.C., in the summer of 1940, when the young lovers in the story meet, and the present, it is deliberately (and annoyingly) coy as to who these oldsters might be.

"MARCU--Eva D. (nee Gerson), Ph.D. Died at the age of 96 on May 12th, 2004. She was born in Dahlem, Germany, and had an epic life both astounding, amazing and distressing. Her father was a Socialist and the kindest man imaginable. He was a philanthropist, giving his wealth to those who had less than he. He persisted in his altruism giving to so many and was betrayed in Marseilles by, it is believed, his driver, and sent to a concentration camp where he was slaughtered with millions of others. Eva married a Rumanian writer, Valeriu, who had left Bucharest quite early in his adult life for Berlin, where he met his future wife at her father's at one of his famed social revelries. Valeriu was always the life blood of any celebration and went to countless such evenings. Her brother was a gentle soul who died at their house in Grasse, in the South of France, where he lived after the war. He had been in British intelligence. With the threat of WWII, Eva and Valeriu moved to Nice, France where Valeriu helped Varien Fry liberate and help to emigrate thousands of artists. It was in Nice where the Marcu's gave birth to a girl, whom they named Miki. Eva and Valeriu, moved to the U.S. (with the help of significant writers given special visa for authors and other intellectuals) and escaped the Nazis. Valeriu died in New York some years later at the age of 40. Eva, therefore, lost the three most momentous men in her life within a few years of each other. She was always the most munificent person (inheriting her father's trait) and gave money, time and her enormous soul to those whom she also thought had less than she, at a time when she had very little. Her gifts were at all times anonymous. She had the soul of an angel, but too unassuming to ever understand or recognize compliments. Her curiosity was inexhaustible and her intelligence dazzling and incomparable. She was Professor of literature at various Universities (Columbia, Mannes, Rutgers), and wrote books and articles, the most significant of which are the maxims of Montaigne and her analysis on the injurious Nationalism of the 16th century and her hero of heroes.

She hated those hours, but made this bargain between the devil and her brain. In March 2003, afraid that her health was failing and that she would be a burden to her daughter, as the indomitable woman she was, without ever seeking advice or consent, decided to move to an independent living home at the Hebrew Home in Riverdale, (coincidentally, the same city where her husband had died). After 8 months her leg was arterially so clogged that nothing other than amputation above the knee was possible. From then on her health declined and she went from her charming apartment overlooking the Hudson and the woods, to the hospital and rehabilitation home then back to her apartment.

" WHEN HOLLYWOOD HAD A KING: The Reign of Lew Wasserman, Who Leveraged Talent Into Power and Influence, by Connie Bruck. (Random House, $16.95.) From the 1950's until 1990, when he sold his film and television company, MCA, to the Japanese conglomerate Matsushita, Wasserman ruled Hollywood as a feared and fearsome force, shifting the balance of power from the studios to the stars. Not only was he a brilliant negotiator and numbers person, ''he was a walking computer before there were computers,'' as one associate told the author. Bruck's ''fascinating book . . . is a methodical portrait of an often secretive mogul whose vindictiveness, cunning and temper matched his shrewdness and prescience,'' Bernard Weinraub wrote here in 2003.    THE DUST OF EMPIRE: The Race for Mastery in the Asian Heartland, by Karl E. Meyer. (PublicAffairs, $15.) A veteran journalist and scholar examines those lands where Britain and Russia collided in the ''great game'' of the late 19th century -- Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia and its former satrapies in Central Asia and the Caucasus. The result is ''a rattling good yarn'' with ''many insights, and some splendid vignettes,'' Geoffrey Wheatcroft said here last year. It is also ''timely to an almost painful degree.''    THE CROSSLEY BABY, by Jacqueline Carey. (Ballantine, $13.95.) Carey makes satirical hay with what might have been a familiar motherhood-versus-career tale of two sisters -- one a full-time mother, the other a high-powered headhunter -- battling each other for custody of their dead sister's baby in 1980's New York. Last year our reviewer, Valerie Sayers, found this a ''slyly seductive'' novel that is ''light and foamy'' though preoccupied with serious subjects like class, responsibility and race.    THE BUG, by Ellen Ullman. (Anchor, $13.95.) Reinventing the story of Frankenstein and his sentient monster as an allegory for the birth of the computer, this first novel takes place in Silicon Valley in 1984, when its heroine, a Ph.D. in the ''linguistics of poetics,'' becomes enamored with an elusive computer bug called ''the Jester'' that threatens to bring down her company. The result is a ''thrilling and intellectually fearless'' tale that ''remains true to the idea-rich gothic melodrama of Shelley's novel,'' Benjamin Anastas wrote in these pages in 2003.    THE MAMMOTH CHEESE, by Sheri Holman. (Grove, $13.) This disarming novel, set in the rural Virginia town of Three Chimneys, swirls around a handful of ordinary yet deeply eccentric souls, among them an artisanal cheesemaker who tries mightily to protect her daughter from the perils of modern life and who makes a 1,235-pound Cheshire for the president of the United States, a replica of a huge cheese once given to Jefferson. ''The story line is droll, but the book is also tough, sad and surprisingly sweet,'' Jennifer Reese said here last year.    THE STORY OF MY FATHER: A Memoir, by Sue Miller. (Random House, $12.95.) The author's account of her father's descent into Alzheimer's disease manages to be lots of things -- painful, comic, bitter, strange, unnerving and touching -- as she chronicles a decline marked by delusions, paranoia, depression and acts of violence. '' 'The Story of My Father' is brave and smart in many of its observations, and haunting in its description of a once confident and intelligent man whose brain has been progressively erasing itself,'' John Vernon wrote here in 2003.    MAISIE DOBBS, by Jacqueline Winspear. (Penguin, $14.) This novel's heroine, having just set up her own private-investigation business in London in 1929, takes on an apparent case of marital infidelity, one that sends her into a convalescent home for World War I veterans -- and back in time to her own nightmarish experiences as a battlefield nurse. Readers will ''be astonished at the sensitivity and wisdom with which Maisie resolves her first professional assignment,'' Marilyn Stasio said here last year.    GRITOS: Essays, by Dagoberto Gilb. (Grove, $13.) The author, a Mexican-American short-story writer and novelist, recalls growing up pocho, or Americanized, in Los Angeles and his experiences living in El Paso and beyond, while also ruminating on Steinbeck and other literary subjects. ''His essays tackle the fantastic, the ridiculous and the racially charged with a conversational style that, smiling, holds all accountable for these absurdities and wrongs,'' one critic wrote earlier this year.

Nine years after they parted, in Vienna, at the end of ''Before Sunrise,'' Jesse (Mr. Hawke) and Celine (Ms. Delpy) rediscover each other in Paris, and relive their brief encounter. This time it is even briefer: the film unfolds, without skipping a minute, in the hour or so before Jesse must catch a plane home to New York, and all those minutes are filled with looping, self-conscious talk as the reunited lovers wander along the Seine. Their intimacy is tinged with nostalgic regret. The airy sense of freedom that they shared in their early 20's has given way to the resignation of adulthood, even as they meander toward a second chance. The liberating sweetness of the earlier movie has mellowed into a saltier, sadder flavor, but Mr. Linklater, one of our most literate and intelligent directors, has not talked himself out of the possibility of romance, and the movie's relaxed, discursive structure is dense with implied feeling and oblique drama (A.

Only in 1995, when her husband's lung disease kept him from chopping wood to heat their home, did Stahl and her husband move to an apartment in St. Paul.

" A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.    Now Playing    ''AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS.'' Starring Jackie Chan and Steve Coogan. Directed by Frank Coraci (PG, 125 minutes). Sometimes nonsense makes good sense. The latest remake of Jules Verne's 1873 globetrotting fantasy is a deliriously silly caper that goes out of its way to thumb its nose at logic. This swatch of epic slapstick, in which three madcap adventurers from London play beat-the-clock in a race to circle the earth, is really a silent comedy with spoken subtitles. What distinguishes this rendition from the nearly three-hour 1956 version, which won the Oscar for best picture, is the presence of that coiled human whirlwind Jackie Chan. As Passepartout, the loyal valet to the fanatical British inventor Phileas Fogg (Mr. Coogan), Mr. Chan makes his entrance diving out of a window in a Keystone Kops-style chase. The whiz-bang set pieces in which he fends off teams of assailants in exotic locales are the movie's high points. The film's witty Rube Goldberg-worthy contraptions remind us that until today's high-tech environment, machines used to be funny. It is refreshing and perhaps even useful to see a movie that shows how susceptible to breakdown they really are. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Kathy Bates put in amusing cameos (Stephen Holden).",https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/02/movies/movie-guide.html,A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film.

One morning last spring, Schmitz met me in the lobby of Mars's North American headquarters, a sprawling industrial complex on a busy road just outside Hackettstown, N.J. The Hackettstown plant is crucial to the Mars business not just for its output -- half of the M&M's sold in the U.S. are produced here -- but also for its research labs. We reached these after Schmitz steered me through security turnstiles at the entrance, a series of carpeted office suites and a labyrinth of polished concrete hallways dense with the dusty, sweet scent of cocoa.

The work ranges from documentary-style shots of avant-garde performance in the mid-1990's to identity-searching photographs and videos, to images of old cities being demolished as new ones rise. The 60 artists represent a mere tip of the creative iceberg in a country changing with breathtaking speed. One way or another, those changes will effect the world. An important show. Center's hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $10; $7, students and 62+. Asia Society hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays to 9 p.m. Admission: $7; $5, students and 65+ (Holland Cotter).",https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/18/arts/art-guide.html,"A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend.
