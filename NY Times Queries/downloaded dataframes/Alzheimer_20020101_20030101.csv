The lovers, both in their 60's when they meet, divorce their mates and enjoy a  brief idyll before the disease manifests itself.

The Select Committee on Stem Cell Research, whose decision gives the green light for cloning to proceed, said licenses to clone human embryos should be granted only to researchers who deposit cells in a stem cell bank and that health officials should be sure that no suitable cell line already exists. Research on cells taken from embryos could lead to cures for illnesses like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

The spending report, issued yesterday by the state treasurer's office, settles a debate that flared in the struggle over this year's budget, as the state faced its worst shortfall in a decade. Gov. James E. McGreevey, above, had insisted that he was holding the line on state spending, while his Republican opponents argued that his proposals would increase spending this year by as much as 9 percent. During 2002, revenue collections fell to $20.6 billion from $21 billion in 2001.

Their departures came after a wave of public concern about accounting practices at the company had sent its stock plummeting more than 90 percent. Mr. Armen said internal investigations found ''no signs of impropriety.'' He said he was optimistic about the drugs being developed by Elan, especially for Alzheimer's disease. He said he expected the search for a new chief executive to conclude in three to six months, and that he would not consider taking the position. In an interview, Mr. Armen said a biopharmaceutical company like Elan would be at its optimum size with product revenue of $300 million to $500 million; Elan generated about $1.2 billion in product revenue in 2001.

TRENTON: Bill For Wine Sampling At Stores; NEWARK: Police Search For Missing Woman:;.,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/26/nyregion/metro-briefing-new-jersey.html,TRENTON: Bill For Wine Sampling At Stores; NEWARK: Police Search For Missing Woman:;.," TRENTON: BILL FOR WINE SAMPLING AT STORES A bill in the New Jersey Legislature would make it legal to hold wine tastings at package stores, enabling store owners to compete with other states that already allow vintage sampling. Bill sponsors hope to increase wine sales, but opponents say the tastings would promote under-age drinking and drunken driving because it would be difficult to monitor how much people are drinking.

" INTERNATIONAL   3-10    Arafat Remains Confined; Tel Aviv Cafe Is Bombed  Israeli forces tightened their grip around Yasir Arafat, sealing the Palestinian leader into three rooms of his compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinian officials said.

"New Chancellor, New Retirements.",https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/13/education/new-chancellor-new-retirements.html,"New Chancellor, New Retirements."," Two veterans of the New York City school system who played important roles under past chancellors have decided to retire just months after moving to the Tweed Courthouse. BURTON SACKS, a liaison to the community school districts and troubleshooter for many a chancellor, is retiring after 33 years in the system. WILLIAM P. CASEY, who helped shape the instructional agenda under Chancellors HAROLD O. LEVY and RUDY CREW, is leaving after 37 years.

" HATESHIP, FRIENDSHIP, COURTSHIP, LOVESHIP, MARRIAGE: Stories, by Alice Munro. (Vintage Contemporaries, $14.) Many of the central characters in these nine tales start out by having a harsh hand dealt them, whether it's cancer, the suicide of an ailing husband or Alzheimer's disease, but somehow manage to find enduring value in their lives as they struggle through their darkest moments. This collection, chosen by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 2001, is ''surely Munro's best yet,'' William H. Pritchard wrote here. Her ''vivid, external perceptions are complemented and balanced by a more exploratory, inwardly poetic kind of writing.''    GERMS: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War, by Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg and William Broad. (Touchstone/Simon & Schuster, $14.) The authors -- two current reporters for The Times and a former Times editor -- tell the story of biological weapons from anthrax to salmonella and the fight against them. ''The tone is somewhat alarmist, but because of the care with which the authors have assembled their case, not to mention our new sense of what is possible, even skeptical readers may have trouble sleeping easily after they finish it,'' Gideon Rose wrote here in 2001. Scourge: The Once and Future Threat of Smallpox, by Jonathan B. Tucker (Grove, $14), traces the history of smallpox from its earliest recorded outbreak in ancient Egypt to its eradication in 1980 and its possible reincarnation as a biological weapon. Last year our reviewer, Ed Regis, found this ''a concise, suspenseful and scientifically accurate narrative.''    CHESTER HIMES: A LIFE, by James Sallis. (Walker, $18.95.) In his ambitious series of Harlem crime novels featuring the detectives Coffin Ed Johnson and Grave Digger Jones, Chester Himes (1909-84) created his most incisive, radical and enduring fiction while finding an outlet for the pain and obsessions of his turbulent personal life. Last year in these pages Robert Polito called this a ''smart, conscientious, often stylish biography'' that is ''admirably tentative about motive and explanation.''    MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH'S MEN, by Padgett Powell. (Louisiana State University, $15.95.) In this novel, a Southern woman of a certain age looks back on the men in her mind's life, chief among them the great Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest. Her thoughts ''create a tumultuous narrative, full of the rancorous prejudices involved in responding to the world around you,'' Robert Kelly wrote in the Book Review in 2000. The result is ''a slim, sly deceiver of a book, full of mirth and wickedness.''    CARTER BEATS THE DEVIL, by Glen David Gold. (Hyperion, $14.95.) This first novel, built around a framework of real events that recapture the long-vanished world of vaudeville, tells of a dazzling, mysterious magician who tangles with a Secret Service agent who holds him responsible for the death of President Warren G. Harding. It is ''a grand story told well, in plain language that glows with bare-bones elegance,'' Stephanie Zacharek wrote here in 2001.    CULTIVATING DELIGHT: A Natural History of My Garden, by Diane Ackerman. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) In 52 lushly drawn but scientifically grounded sections, the author -- a poet by training -- follows her garden from spring through winter, ruminating on the stare of a cardinal or the prodigious oceanic journeys of the arctic tern. ''Reading Ackerman's book reminds us that we too can make our paradise here and that tranquillity can be achieved by contemplating the petals of a rose,'' Miranda Seymour said here last year.    SELDOM DISAPPOINTED: A Memoir, by Tony Hillerman. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) The author of the Jim Chee- Joe Leaphorn series of Navajo crime novels recalls, at 75, his hardscrabble Oklahoma upbringing, his service in World War II (he lost most of a foot and sight in one eye) and his long career as a newspaperman. '' 'Seldom Disappointed' is a splendid and disarming remembrance of things past,'' Timothy Foote wrote here in 2001.    DAVID BORING, by Daniel Clowes. (Pantheon, $16.95.) This comic book geared for adults revolves around a laconic 19-year-old whose wanderings in search of a lost lover take him deep into Hitchcock and David Lynch territory. In 2000 our reviewer, Dave Eggers, praised ''the perfect interplay'' between Clowes's ''tightly controlled artwork, the empty . . . rage simmering just beneath it, and just below that, a strangely simple yearning for simple and solid things, like, say, love.''

The troupes, which include the Circle of Dance, the North Shore Dance Theater and the Long Island Dance Company, will perform at 8 p.m. Saturday and 3 p.m. next Sunday at Five Towns College in Dix Hills.

She lets slip (hmm!) that one of her patients is a mobster, much to Richard`s consternation.

His challenge boldly proclaims what until then has been implicit: the richest and most compelling piece of television-no, of popular culture-that I`ve encountered in the past twenty years is a meditation on the nature of morality, the possibility of redemption, and the legacy of Freud.
