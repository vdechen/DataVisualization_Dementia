The spending report, issued yesterday by the state treasurer's office, settles a debate that flared in the struggle over this year's budget, as the state faced its worst shortfall in a decade. Gov. James E. McGreevey, above, had insisted that he was holding the line on state spending, while his Republican opponents argued that his proposals would increase spending this year by as much as 9 percent.
