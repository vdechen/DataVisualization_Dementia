"Of my own identity and profession I have little to say, and indeed, they have no bearing on the particulars of the horrors I am to describe.

This weakness, I must surmise, has been the motor of my destruction.

On the evening I now reckon to forebode the onset of my dementia, I had settled into the dim recesses of my chamber, a low-vaulted, fustian studio bestrewn with collectible curiosa and forgotten volumes of TV Guide. The sky to the west had surrendered the last feeble rays of what I personally believe to be a dying star, and the room's only illumination was the ghastly flickering pallor of the demonic jumping box -- so named, I presume, for its feverish, oscillating images of the mindlessly upbeat. I sat motionless, seized by the unnameable but palpable terror that has been noted in my medical reports since my school days, and turned my gaze to the aforementioned television -- as luminous in the gloaming as a gypsy's crystal -- hoping to see thereon escapist visions of the bygone musicals of leggy, lissome Annabel Lee (now, reason told me but passion denied, deceased) or the glitteringly bedizened game-show letter-turner whom the agents call Lenore.

In the catalogue of the show, there is a haunting picture of her at 14. Her face is a delicate oval, her skin is as smooth as silk.

"  MY MOTHER IS SPEAKING FROM THE DESERT. Everything she says now is spoken from the desert, a desert she has in part created. But only in part. Mostly, I suppose, the desert was created because she is 86 and something has hardened or broken or worn out. The part she made came about through a dark will and sense of worthlessness. Believing she deserves nothing, she surrounds herself with empty air. The sun gleams in her eyes. Her eyes can sometimes seem colorless, as if they were ruined by looking at the sun. Sometimes she looks blind. Her eyes are very beautiful. The rest of her face is gaunt now and so you must look at her eyes: you can't look at anything else.   When she hasn't combed her hair, when she has lost a tooth she won't have attended to, when she won't cut or file her nails, or change her clothes, she is distressing to look at. She used to be a very buoyant person, fleshy, with a wonderful skin that always made you think of the inner flesh of fruit: an apple or a peach. When she wore sleeveless dresses in summer, the cool, thick muscles of her upper arms made you want to rest your hot cheeks against them. The freshness and crispness of those dresses was a miracle. Their colors were the colors of nature: sea green, sky blue. It was as if she were wearing the elements themselves -- the limitless sky, the refreshing sea -- instead of a dress made of material whose shade was only a reminder of sea or sky.",https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/19/magazine/my-mother-is-speaking-from-the-desert.html,,"MY MOTHER IS SPEAKING FROM THE DESERT.
