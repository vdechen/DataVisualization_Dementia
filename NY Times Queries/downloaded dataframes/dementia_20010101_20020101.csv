She was a faculty member of the School of Education of NYU and did post-doctoral study in Europe. She was a member of the Founding Faculty of Bronx Community College. Teachers inevitably have the opportunity to influence the lives of their students. This is a privilege which Dr. Mullin sensed instinctively and with sensitivity throughout her entire professional and post-professional life.

The clinical slides of afflicted animals are unpleasant enough. They show blistered tongues and gums, lesions on the coronary band, where hair meets hoof, a look of slackness and profuse salivation. But the news photographs are genuinely gruesome -- stiff, swollen cattle stacked on their backs in long rows for mass interment, sheep penned in great herds for killing, farmers looking away from the sight of it all in grief and disgust. If you believe Daniel Defoe, whose ''A Journal of the Plague Year'' is closely attested fiction, one of the worst horrors of the 1665 London plague was the shutting up of houses where infection was discovered.

"WEST CALIFORNIA: RULING VOIDS PART OF DRUG LAW A federal appeals court panel has struck down a federal law that lets judges, after a jury conviction, add years to a prison term for a drug- trafficking offense based on the amount of drugs involved.

Earlier this year, Lt. Gov. Bill Ratliff said that he would not run for election as lieutenant governor in 2002 and might step away from politics altogether.

Later, the league voted to accept St. Sabina, but the school's pastor said it would join only if members agreed not to forfeit games at St. Sabina. On Thursday the league approved a compromise forfeiture policy under which coaches are bound to play scheduled games and must explain forfeitures.    (AP) OHIO: WATER LEVEL CAUSED EXPLOSION Low water levels caused last month's explosion of an antique steam-powered tractor that killed five people at a county fair in Medina, invest",https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/11/national/national-briefing.html,"WEST CALIFORNIA: RULING VOIDS PART OF DRUG LAW A federal appeals court panel has struck down a federal law that lets judges, after a jury conviction, add years to a prison term for a drug- trafficking offense based on the amount of drugs involved....", WEST ,,,The New York Times,[],"[{'name': 'glocations', 'value': 'California (USA)', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'organizations', 'value': 'STATE', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Nieves, Evelyn', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Suits and Litigation', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Politics and Government', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'United States Politics and Government', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'States (US)', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}]",2001-08-11T05:00:00+0000,article,National,U.S.,News,nyt://article/7f642005-cbd5-5448-aed8-03b535d3a704,737,nyt://article/7f642005-cbd5-5448-aed8-03b535d3a704,National Briefing,,,National Briefing,,,,By,[],,dementia,
