Becoming single in midlife through death or divorce dramatically increases risk for dementia in the older years.,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/01/blogs/01well-marriage471.html,Becoming single in midlife through death or divorce dramatically increases risk for dementia in the older years.,"(Photo: (Credit:Benjamin Sklar/Associated Press))   Whether you are single or divorced in midlife appears to influence your risk of developing Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia as you age.  It's long been known that social relationships can decrease the risk of developing dementia. In June, Harvard researchers reported how active socializing in old age could delay memory problems.   But most research on social relationships and dementia measures the social life of the very old. The newest study, presented at the 2008 Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease in Chicago, focused on the effect relationships in midlife may have on long-term risk. It tracked 2,000 men and women in Finland beginning at the age of 50 and followed up with them 21 years later.   They found that people who were living with a spouse or a partner in midlife ran a 50 percent lower risk of developing dementia during their older years than people living alone. How long a person had been single and the reason they were single also affected risk. Living alone for your entire adult life doubled risk, but those who had been married and then divorced and remained single in midlife showed three times the risk.  Those at greatest risk of developing dementia were people who had lost their partner before middle age and then continued to live as a widow or widower. The study showed that these individuals had a six times greater chance of developing Alzheimer's than those who were married.  ""This suggests two influencing factors -- social and intellectual stimulation and trauma,"" said lead author Krister Håkansson, a psychology researcher at Växjö University and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. ""In practice, it shows how important it is to put resources into helping people who have undergone a crisis.""  Dr. Håkansson said future research will focus on whether risk is influenced by the quality of the relationship or whether someone always intended to live a single life or not.

Sue Halpern finds out what scientists know about dementia.,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/books/review/Dunn-t.html,Sue Halpern finds out what scientists know about dementia.,"Behind all the good-natured joking about “senior moments” lies real frustration and fear. How empowering, then, that we can do something to ward off normal, age-related memory loss: exercise. No, it’s not as easy as popping a pill. But as Sue Halpern reports in “Can’t Remember What I Forgot,” even a few brisk walks per week can have a measurable effect. Exercise promotes the birth of new neurons in the very part of the hippocampus (a brain structure crucial to forming new memories) that begins to malfunction with age. Exercise also counters age-related shrinking of the prefrontal cortex, an area involved in concentration and working memory (as in remembering a phone number long enough to dial).",BR,23,The New York Times,"[{'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'articleInline', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2008/05/25/books/dunn-190.jpg', 'height': 265, 'width': 190, 'legacy': {}, 'subType': 'articleInline', 'crop_name': 'articleInline'}, {'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'thumbnail', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2008/05/25/books/dunn-75.jpg', 'height': 75, 'width': 75, 'legacy': {'thumbnail': 'images/2008/05/25/books/dunn-75.jpg', 'thumbnailwidth': 75, 'thumbnailheight': 75}, 'subType': 'thumbnail', 'crop_name': 'thumbStandard'}]","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Memory', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Books and Literature', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Medicine and Health', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': ""Alzheimer's Disease"", 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Dementia', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Aphasia', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Halpern, Sue', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}]",2008-05-25T04:00:00+0000,article,BookReview,Books,Review,nyt://article/3863332c-e84d-5559-906c-122cee93f98f,913,nyt://article/3863332c-e84d-5559-906c-122cee93f98f,Partial Recall,,,Partial Recall,,,,By Kyla Dunn,"[{'firstname': 'Kyla', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'Dunn', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,Book Review,,Alzheimer

"There are more online tools than ever for caregivers, but which ones are useful?",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/blogs/30newoldage-caregivi85.html,"There are more online tools than ever for caregivers, but which ones are useful?","(Photo: The home pages of the Alzheimer's Association, left, and newcomer Caring.com.)   Since this blog began in July, hardly a day goes by without a press release or Google alert about a new or improved Web site intended to assist family caregivers. Today, the Alzheimer's Association -- long at the forefront of reaching out to caregivers, due to the intensity and duration of the disease -- further expands its user-friendly site with a caregiver stress check, which begins with a series of questions like these:   ""Do you regularly feel like you have to do it all yourself, and that you should be doing more?""   ""Do you withdraw from family, friends and activities you used to enjoy?""   ""Do you worry that the person you care for is safe?""   Those who reply ""yes"" to any of the questions are directed to association programs targeted to each user's particular issues, including local chapters for respite or day care services, brochures and message boards, or telephone consultations available around the clock.  Peter Reed, senior director of programs at the Alzheimer's Association, noted that 5 million Americans currently have Alzheimer's disease; 70 percent of them live at home, and 10 million family members and friends supervise their care. In the baby boom cohort, 77 million strong, 10 million are expected ultimately to develop the disease, Dr. Reed said. Their caregivers, today's 20- and 30-somethings, will be even more Internet-savvy than the current crop of family caregivers.   Dr. Reed said the association aims to give people ""what they need, how they need it and when they need it,'' which can mean face-to-face services in the community, telephone counsel or online resources. ""All the modalities are growing,'' he said, along with the caseload. ""But we have to prepare for the generational shifts.''   The Alzheimer's Association is hardly alone in pouring caregiving resources into the Internet. I have found the most comprehensive sites, in both the public and private sector, to include:   AARP  Caring.com  Strength for Caring  MetLife Mature Market Institute  the National Alliance For Caregiving  the National Family Caregivers Association  the federal Administration on Aging  the Alzheimer's Association      Medicare also has revamped its historically chaotic Web site to consolidate all information and services for caregivers on one page.  With my own caregiving days behind me, I find the interactive tools fascinating; the checklists, brochures and resources informative (although redundant from site to site); and the expert essays well-meaning (but predictable, often dull and a bit too cheerful for my taste). None of these online resources existed during the years of my mother's decline and our seat-of-the-pants scramble to properly take care of her.   Still, I'm not a techy -- then or now -- and I often wonder if I would have used these sites and, if so, found them useful and consoling, or else just another activity I didn't have time for, like the caregiver support groups I shunned but that may well have been helpful. All of you are better judges than I.   Do you use these and other Web sites? Do they save time and ease decision-making? Is the information accurate, well organized and current? Which are your favorites and why? What are the sites missing, or doing poorly, that you'd like to see changed? Are there other blogs, as well as Web sites, that you read regularly?   We maintain a list of many of these resources. We would like for our choices to reflect your experiences and not to waste your time, since one thing I do know is that you don't have any to waste. Please tell us and other readers what has helped you and how we can do a better job of directing everyone to the best the Web has to offer.

A federal agency offers a helping hand -- finally.,https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/blogs/18newoldage-medicare67.html,A federal agency offers a helping hand -- finally.,"(Photo: The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has launched a new site for caregivers. (The New York Times))   What do you mean Medicare doesn't pay for it?  Nothing shocked me more in the early days of caring for my elderly mother than the discovery that Medicare, the U.S.'s universal health coverage for those ages 65 and older, does not pay for so many of the things the frail elderly require.   Not home health aides for those who can't get out of bed, bathe, dress or feed themselves. Not an assisted-living facility, with handicap-accessible apartments, congregate meals and transportation services. Not nursing homes where the most helpless of the elderly live out their days with round-the-clock supervision.  This remains true, and will remain so absent a complete overhaul of Medicare legislation, which was written in the 1960s when life expectancy was shorter and fewer people lived long enough to require long-term care. But starting today, on the federal government's new Web page for caregivers, it will be easier to figure out what Medicare does cover and what it doesn't; to find community-based resources to take up the slack; to access other government and non-profit agencies that assist the elderly and their caregivers (most often adult children); and to find the message boards, online forums and blogs that have proliferated along with the exploding needs of these two generations.  Kerry Weems, the acting administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the driving force behind its new one-stop-shopping Web page, acknowledges that all but the poorest Americans are on their own when it comes to paying for long-term care. ""Unless Congress steps in, we have to be obedient to the legislation,'' he said, noting that the Medicare trust fund is already in such desperate straits that it could not begin to absorb the cost of long-term care.   So he is troubled by widespread misunderstanding about this, by polls showing the majority of Americans believe that Medicare will, indeed, pay for what is known as custodial care. ""We should be shouting from the rooftops, as often as we can, that Medicare does not have a long-term care benefit,'' Mr. Weems said.   That is clearer than ever before on the new Web page, ""Ask Medicare,"" which aggregates many useful resources previously difficult to find or incoherently presented on the sprawling Web site of federal Department of Health and Human Services. ""Ask Medicare'' serves as a gateway to rich stores of information and support from both government and non-government sources, including AARP, the Administration on Aging, the Alzheimer's Association, the National Alliance for Caregiving, and even Johnson & Johnson. All have Web sites of their own that include informational essays by experts, interactive tools and various networking opportunities for caregivers who so often find themselves terribly isolated. (Our own resources page is here.)  ""We must acknowledge and support the people who are doing this hard, exhausting and essential work,'' Mr. Weems said, ""by helping them find the information they need to care for the people they love.'' His own wife, he noted, had been a long-distance caregiver to her mother through 11 years of Alzheimer's disease, simultaneously raising three teenagers and working full time.  So why is it Medicare has seemed so slow to recognize that adult children and other caregivers are baffled by the complexities of government entitlement programs for the elderly, as well as by all the confounding residential, legal and financial decisions they must make? Why did the new ""Ask Medicare"" page lag behind, say, Johnson & Johnson's Web site for caregivers, called Strength for Caring?   ""Are we late to the party?'' Mr. Weems asked, repeating a reporter's question. ""This is a personal project of mine. I was handed her helm here a year ago, and it took a while to get it going. I'd rather celebrate that we're at the party than whether we got there late or not.''

Returning home to care for aging parents can have its blessings.,https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/blogs/09newoldage-you-can-62.html,Returning home to care for aging parents can have its blessings.,"A recent ""Vows'' column in The New York Times recounts the magical reunion and marriage of Amy Dickinson, the syndicated advice columnist for the Chicago Tribune, and Bruno Schickel, the older brother of a childhood friend in the Finger Lakes town of Freeville, N.Y. (population 505), where they both grew up.   Mary Ellen Geist and her father, Woody, in 2005, shortly after she returned to Michigan to care for him. (Fabrizio Costantini for The New York Times)  Ms. Dickinson, now 48, had fled life on a dairy farm for success in the big city; Mr. Schickel, 52, had stuck close to home and become a builder. Every small town high school class, she notes, divides into two groups: those who can't wait to leave and those who wouldn't dream of it. Ms. Dickinson and Mr. Schickel were in opposing camps until last summer, when Ms. Dickinson came home to Freeville to take care of her ailing mother. She and Mr. Schickel had both married, had children and now were divorced.  You can guess what happened from there.   Don't miss the full account, which I immediately sent to two friends, both early stalwarts of the can't-wait-to-leave group. Yet they, too, had abandoned high-profile journalism careers, in San Francisco and New York, to return to the small towns where they were raised in order to help their parents.   I asked them both -- Stephanie Salter, formerly a columnist for the San Francisco Examiner and later the San Francisco Chronicle, and Mary Ellen Geist, who had been a radio reporter and anchor in California and New York -- to tell us of the unexpected blessings of going home again, the last thing they ever expected to do.   Ms. Salter returned to Terre Haute, Ind., in 2004 after her father was diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer. He died that same year, but she remained to be near her mother. Ms. Salter is now an assistant editor and columnist for Terre Haute's daily newspaper, the Tribune Star. Her thoughts:    All the years I lived away from Terre Haute -- nearly five in New York, 29 in San Francisco -- I thought moving back would be my nightmare come true. It hasn't turned out that way. Romance hasn't blossomed as in Amy Dickinson's life, but friendships that were mostly Christmas-card level have deepened, and new ones have shown me how narrow-minded I was about people who don't live in big cities. (As if the never-lefts were incapable of being artists and intellectuals, of possessing good taste and passports, of being complex humans who are interesting and fun to be around!)      The older I have gotten, the more I've become convinced that many of this country's most acute ills can be traced to our abandonment of a sense of community. I always worked to keep that sense in San Francisco (and did), but it is easier to do in a smaller arena where our interconnectedness is so obvious. A factory shuts down or a new restaurant opens, and much of the community feels it. A $25 contribution to the local art museum makes a difference.       Your neighbor is the nurse who helped take care of your dad when he was dying. Twice a year you plant trees all day on a Saturday with everyone from the mayor to the guy who sat behind you in 11th-grade study hall. Everybody's name and address is in the phone book. People actually sit on their front porches, call your name and invite you up for a glass of wine. I could also add that I have known my dentist and my state senator since we were all in the third grade, and the county sheriff since I was in high school dancing as a go-go girl (very modest costumes) to the records he spun when he was a disk jockey.      I miss San Francisco and my friends there, profoundly, but I've always believed we can make a good life where ever we go. After four years back in Terre Haute, I am walking proof that the belief is true. And I still can't get over paying $73,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bath home on a third of an acre in a city district that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. I rent out my home in S.F. (which cost considerably more than $73,000) to my youngest niece and her boyfriend, and I return for visits at least twice a year -- just the reverse of all those years I lived in California.     Ms. Geist moved back home, to Washington, Mich., in 2005, to share with her mother the task of caring for her father, who has advanced Alzheimer's disease. She recently published a book about the ongoing experience, called ""Measure of the Heart: A Father's Alzheimer's, A Daughter's Return.'' Her thoughts on going home again:    We were not the kind of people who showed up for college reunions wearing class colors. In fact, only a few of us attended any college gatherings at all in the thirty years since we'd graduated. The Kalamazoo College class of 1978: we were the ""Question Authority"" generation. There wasn't much ""rah-rah"" in any of us.       We found each other first at our college freshman year orientation in an Outward Bound-type program. Before heading to the campus for the first time, we hiked the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, got blisters together, learned how to rappel down cliffs and zip across rivers. We sang Beatles medleys as we trudged through the rain carrying heavy backpacks. We each survived a three-day solo in the woods, which was supposed to build our character.       Some of us had mystical experiences, some of us had close encounters with bears, and others only had indigestion. We slept under the stars. We held contests to see how long we could last in the chilly waters of Lake Superior. We participated in those 1970s trust exercises, and gathered in circles at night around the campfire for amateur psychology sessions. Then we spent a week sailing a boat across Lake Superior. At one point, during a fierce storm, my friend Michael and I were both curled over the starboard side, losing our lunches in the huge waves. Michael threw up in my hair. It bonded us forever.      Four years later we graduated, and it was as if we'd been ordered to spread to the four corners of the earth. One person went to Spain. Another to Bahrain. Several headed to New York. Two went to Chicago. Two got married and moved to Atlanta. One went to Washington, D.C. Two wound up on the West Coast. One landed in Ann Arbor, Mich. Some disappeared entirely for a few years.       Over the past three decades, there have been weddings and other special events, which the Midwest and East Coast members of our group somehow managed to attend. I was the one on the West Coast who always said ""I'll try to make it."" But work almost always got in the way. I began to feel further and further away.      But there was one of us who always showed up whenever any important event occurred, and that was Michael, the one who threw up in my hair. I still remember seeing his face when I looked out at the crowd during my wedding in 1988. The marriage didn't last, but Michael did.      Last Christmas, we all got the news: Michael was getting married to Kevin! The first gay wedding in our group! I had quit my job to come home to Michigan to help take care of my father, who has Alzheimer's. Michael was getting married on August 2 in Ann Arbor, just a four-hour drive down the expressway. This time, my work wasn't going to get in the way.       When Michael and Kevin appeared in the vestibule wearing their gorgeous light gray suits and Ferragamo shoes, each with his mother on his arm, more than a dozen members of the Kalamazoo College class of 1978 all looked at each other and began to cry.      Since the wedding, we're all e-mailing and calling each other. Maybe this time we'll continue the bond. Because of Michael. Because of Michael and Kevin's love.       And because of my father, who brought me home.    As always, we want to hear your stories, of daughters (and, yes, sons) who left well-established careers, out of love and a sense of duty but with great trepidation, to return to a place, people and a way of life they never anticipated revisiting in middle age.

A new blog dedicates space to mental health issues raised by celebrities. Is this a good thing?.,https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/blogs/10well-celebrit701.html,A new blog dedicates space to mental health issues raised by celebrities. Is this a good thing?.,"(Photo: Carrie Fisher has written a memoir about mental health. Katherine Heigl plays a character struggling with brain problems. Britney Spears fell victim to hospital workers' snooping about her mental health. (Axel Koester, J. Emilio Flores and Christopher Smith for The New York Times))   Celebrity shenanigans make headlines. But do we need a blog devoted to their mental health issues?  One of my favorite mental health Web sites, PsychCentral, thinks we do. The site has launched a new blog devoted to mental health issues surrounding celebrities called Celebrity Psychings. Writes PsychCentral founder John M. Grohol:   Celebrities have the ability to reach an audience who ordinarily might not even think about (or recognize the legitimacy of) mental health concerns. While we're not into celebrity worship here, we believe that people can use their popularity for good when they talk about mental health issues out loud and in public. The more people get talking about mental health, the more it reduces the stigmatization and misinformation about these issues.  One of the latest posts focuses on the actress Carrie Fisher, who has bipolar disorder and is promoting a new memoir, ""Wishful Drinking"" (Simon & Schuster). Other items look at how mental health issues are being portrayed in the media, including shows like ""Boston Legal,"" where William Shatner's character, Denny Crane, has been coping with the onset of Alzheimer's.   The blog is written by Alicia Sparks, formerly of the Mental Health Notes blog. While the posts often contain more chatter than I would like, I agree with Dr. Grohol that celebrities have the power to bring needed attention to important issues.   I looked for examples of celebrity news on the Well blog. Stories have included:   Do the Rules Apply to Dr. Phil? Patient privacy and Britney Spears. An Actor's Diagnosis Brings Attention to Pancreatic Cancer: Actor Patrick Swayze's cancer diagnosis. Parents' New Miley Problem: Celebrity misdeeds and how they affect our kids.  Food Allergies Hit the Music Charts: Singer Trace Adkins brings attention to food allergy.  Michael Phelps and the Potential of A.D.H.D.: The Olympic swimmer's childhood diagnosis of attention deficit problems.    A Hollywood Family Takes on Medical Mistakes: The story of a medical error that almost killed the twin babies of actor Dennis Quaid.  More Celebrity Snooping by Hospital Workers: Privacy violations affecting actress Farah Fawcett.  Hot Maybe, But Not Smoking: Model Tyra Banks bans smoking on a reality show.   Reality Dance Show Puts Rett Syndrome in the Spotlight: A celebrity choreographer raises awareness about a little-known illness.   What do you think?

"Dr. Cheryl Woodson, an experienced geriatrician, offers some advice on navigating the caregiving maze.",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/20/blogs/20newoldage-10-thing76.html,"Dr. Cheryl Woodson, an experienced geriatrician, offers some advice on navigating the caregiving maze.","Dr. Cheryl Woodson, you may recall from last week's post, is a seasoned geriatrician in Chicago Heights, Ill., who has found that she can no longer afford to accept new Medicare patients.   She is also a blunt and funny woman who liberally dispenses wisdom to her elderly patients and their adult children, and herself a daughter who cared for her own mother with Alzheimer's disease for a decade. Here's some of Dr. Woodson's advice on navigating the caregiving maze, which I culled both from her book, ""To Survive Caregiving,"" and from observing her during a recent day-long visit to her office.   (Photo: Dr. Cheryl Woodson, geriatrician and author of ""To Survive Caregiving."" (Sally Ryan for The New York Times))   1. Assisted living, a popular solution for elderly people who cannot live independently, is a ""myth,"" Dr. Woodson said, ""a place for people who don't exist."" Families often believe these facilities will meet all of their loved ones' needs, enabling caregivers to focus on jobs and family, only to find this isn't the case. Before long, the elderly resident will require more than ""meals you don't have to cook, grass you don't have to cut and socialization,'' Dr. Woodson said. At that point the elderly resident is in trouble, since assisted living facilities are not permitted by law to provide medical care and consider it to be the family's responsibility.   2. Squaring a family's expectations with those legal limits would require a thorough, first-hand assessment of the elderly person's physical and cognitive health before admission to an assisted living facility. That rarely happens. New residents are admitted based on a report from their current physicians, who may not be qualified to diagnose the early signs of dementia and impending immobility or may sugarcoat the situation in order to help a desperate family. ""They just need a little help,'' the usual rationale for accepting elderly prospects into assisted living, is ridiculous on its face, Dr. Woodson said. ""If they just needed a little help, they'd still be in the community.""   3. Instead, without verifying the physician's report or the family's representations, these facilities may admit residents who already need help with simple tasks like dressing or eating, or will in the very near future, and then charge extra for these services. Some do this to fill empty beds; others give residency a shot as a kindness to desperate families, Dr. Woodson said. But when the resident declines, as all of them will unless they die suddenly, more and more a la carte services mean a bigger and bigger monthly bill, or more and more work for family members who expected the opposite.  4. Coordinating all the services that the assisted living facility doesn't provide generally falls to one sibling, Dr. Woodson noted, who then becomes overwhelmed, sacrificing more than should be expected. The solution is hiring a geriatric care manager -- ""They should be called rent-a-daughters,'' Dr. Woodson said -- adding further to the expense, until the resident and family can no longer afford this kind of accommodation and are forced to consider a nursing home.  5. Most families balk at the prospect of transferring an aging parent to a nursing home because they like the aesthetics of assisted living -- the carpeted floors, overstuffed chairs and crystal chandeliers. But without round-the-clock care, many residents are ""as alone at night as if they were in their own homes,'' Dr. Woodson said. Other families are unwilling to break a promise to Mom or Dad never to put them in a nursing home. The spirit of that promise -- to give a parent the best possible care -- is what matters, Dr. Woodson said, ""and sometimes that means not doing it yourself.'' An aging parent's condition may eventually require three shifts of nurses and aides, not a family member trying to take care of everything 24/7.  6. The doctors who see residents at assisted living facilities are essentially freelancers, not employees, since their fees are paid by Medicare and they also may maintain private practices. So rather than hang around the facility expecting them to answer your questions on the fly, Dr. Woodson suggested calling and arranging to see them ""by appointment, not by ambush.'' This consultation will not be covered by Medicare unless it coincides with a medical procedure for the resident. Still, it is essential in order to stay on top of an elderly person's medications, some of which may be unnecessary and even dangerous, and to make decisions about which medical care improves the quality of life and which is pointless and wasteful.  7. If a parent lives in an assisted living facility, families should closely monitor the monthly pharmacy bill, less for cost than for content. Is Xanax being prescribed for anxiety? There are numerous other remedies available without the potentially dangerous side effects. What about muscle relaxants for arthritic pain? They increase confusion in the elderly and add to the risk of falls; instead, ask for pain medication and/or a heating pad. If the assisted living facility offers to have prescriptions filled and delivered by a local pharmacy -- a huge convenience for family members -- be sure it's a pharmacy that insists upon periodic blood work or other tests for drugs that are supposed to be closely monitored.  8. The goal of medical care for the elderly, in Dr. Woodson's view and the view of every geriatrician I've ever interviewed, is to make day-to-day life more comfortable, not to cure illness or extend longevity. Examples? A joint replacement to relieve pain and improve mobility makes sense only if the patient has the cognitive ability to complete physical therapy. Otherwise, he or she will never walk again and would be better off avoiding surgery and simply being kept comfortable. Similarly, anyone who would refuse cancer treatment because of advanced age probably doesn't need a mammogram, Pap smear or colonoscopy. ""Why draw a map to someplace we know we're not going?'' Dr. Woodson asked.  9. Apply similar standards to immunizations and vaccinations. If someone is so ill or disabled that death would be welcome, refuse the vaccine for pneumonia, long known as ""the old person's friend.'' But never say no to the shingles vaccine, which can prevent an excruciating rash. ""Even if someone was only going to live five more minutes, that's the one thing I'd suggest,'' Dr. Woodson says. ""It's a quality-of-life issue.''  10. Do not assume that the presenting symptom of Alzheimer's disease will be forgetting words, losing things or other obvious examples of short-term memory loss. Often the first thing a family member will notice is an empty checking account, Dr. Woodson said, because a normally cautious and frugal person has been tricked by a get-rich-quick scheme or other scam. And like missing money, look out for pills missing from those seven-day dispensers that help people with multiple medications keep track of what they're taking and when. Family members may find the dispensers empty and worry about overdose, Dr. Woodson noted, but often the missing pills will turn up under couch cushions or scattered elsewhere around the house. Take this as a cue that it may be time for a cognitive assessment.

Scientific evidence is accumulating that Mediterranean fare is optimal for health.,https://consults.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/blogs/03consults-whats-th23.html,Scientific evidence is accumulating that Mediterranean fare is optimal for health.,"(Photo: Diners at an outdoor cafe in Corsica, France. (Ed Alcock for The New York Times))   What exactly do doctors mean by a ""healthy diet""?  Many of us consider the Mediterranean diet to be the closest thing known to an ideal meal plan, rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals, fish, olive oil and, yes, a bit of red wine with meals. Compared to traditional American menu -- high in red meat and in butter and other dairy products -- the Mediterranean diet is lower in saturated fat, more varied and often more satisfying.  Decades worth of research also suggests that this way of eating is healthier. Many studies have documented reduced rates of heart disease and cancer among those adhering to a Mediterranean diet, compared to those eating more red meat and dairy-based regimens. Most of these studies have involved observations rather than actual intervention trials, however, and they have varied in size.  Now the British Medical Journal has published a systematic compilation of a dozen of the most methodologically sound of these observational studies, which included over 1.5 million people followed for up to eighteen years, analyzing cardiovascular consequences and some other important health outcomes. This large meta-analysis found decreased cardiovascular death as well as cancer mortality, and a lowered incidence of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, in those following the Mediterranean diet versus those on other diets.   While such meta-analyses have limitations and cannot be considered as persuasive as large, randomized intervention trials, the new study further supports the idea that the Mediterranean diet can confer important health benefits.  Different diets abound, many even promoted by physicians. But it's a mistake to think of a diet as a temporary measure; instead, it is a lifetime commitment to healthy choices. Need to lose weight now? Don't rush. Take comfort in knowing that even a modest incremental reduction can confer significant health benefits, lowering your risk of heart disease or diabetes. Crash diets only set us up for ""yo-yo"" weight loss and regain.   Whatever eating habits you adopt must be sustainable over the long term. Many researchers regard this as the Mediterranean diet's greatest strength. You can stick to it, and like it, year after year.  How sad, then, to learn that a diet that whose adherents were among the longest-lived in the world is now fading from view. The governments of Greece, Italy, Spain and Morocco have asked that UNESCO designate the Mediterranean diet an ""intangible piece of cultural heritage."" But as The Times recently reported, fast food is proliferating across the Mediterranean region, threatening to propagate a U.S.-style obesity epidemic.   In Greece, three-quarters of the adult population is now overweight or obese, and at increasing risk for diabetes, heart disease and arthritis, among other maladies. ""Much of the highly praised diet didn't exist any more,'' said a senior economist at the United Nations who conducted a recent survey of regional eating habits. ''It has become just a notion.'' Rather than turning our backs on this traditional diet, the new data suggest we could all derive substantial health benefits from it.

If only I'd had the 800 number for Compassion & Choices in the last difficult months of my mother's life. She was paralyzed, incontinent and unable to speak. I watched the light leave her eyes and her body crumple like a rag doll's, and I knew that one day soon she would say, ""Enough.''   During this period, my mother and I talked and talked and talked about her end-of-life choices, as we had for many years. A decade earlier the conversation had seemed totally academic, even a bit weird. But now we were both grateful that this was familiar territory. At regular family meetings at the nursing home where she lived, the social workers, nurses and doctors joined what had been our private dialog. Our willingness to look my mother's certain death squarely in the eye, they said, was both unusual in families and beneficial to her quality of life.   Despite my mother's helplessness and misery those last months, she wasn't dying of anything. She had a garden-variety set of ailments for an 87-year-old woman: high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, an inner-ear disturbance. A series of imperceptible strokes, known as T.I.A.'s, had left her body useless. But they didn't necessarily portend a deadly event. She'd dodged the bullets of cancer, serious heart or pulmonary disease, and dementia. It is not uncommon, having lived past 85, to keep on living for a very long time -- ""healthy'' in the narrow sense of the word, but increasingly incapacitated. That, alas, was my mother's fate.   She often longed for the oblivion of Alzheimer's disease. But her sharp mind -- she never skipped a beat -- entitled her to organize her own death, within legal limits, which she did by deciding to stop food and hydration. We had discussed and researched this option, and we had read enough to be reasonably confident this manner of dying was not a frightful ordeal but rather a gentle death. We trusted that an enlightened nursing home like the one she was in wouldn't force her to eat and drink. They had readily accepted earlier decisions to forgo diagnostic tests or hospitalizations, and later antibiotics for pneumonia.   Our study of what is known as V.S.E.D., or ""voluntarily stopping eating and drinking,"" was impressive for amateurs, if I do say so myself. My mother had a pretty good death, on her own terms, and we had the nursing home's full support. I'm proud and grateful to have been able to advocate for her and to have been by her side. That said, there were several rough patches. And after recently meeting Judy Schwarz, the patient support coordinator for Compassion & Choices in New York, I now can see we'd have had an easier time of it had she been along for the ride.   What follows are a few of the bumps in the road that I bet would have been smoothed with her expert guidance.   * Medical professionals can only guess how long it takes to die of dehydration. (Merely refusing food is a bad idea, as many people who have gone on long hunger strikes can surely attest.) My mother's nurses and doctors said she'd likely last four, five, six days -- a week at most. With that in mind, I settled into a recliner in her room with books, music, snacks and a few changes of clothes, and I intended to stay by her side, as promised, for the duration.   In fact, she lived for 13 days, alert and communicative for about a week and manifesting none of the signs of impending death until the last 36 to 48 hours. Why the discrepancy? People in my mother's robust condition rarely make this choice. It is typically how people die in the end stages of cancer or Alzheimer's disease, following a progressive loss of interest or ability to eat and drink -- not an abrupt dinner-yesterday-but-no-breakfast-today-thank-you-very-much announcement. I don't know if my mother experienced time as I did, but to me it felt interminable. To my shame, I did a lot of clock-watching. Eventually I went home at night, leaving behind a private-duty aide.   I doubt I'd have twitched with impatience, just wanting for it to be over, had I known that the average dying time is two to three weeks, as the scientific literature says. Judy Schwarz would have told me that. I think the days would have been more peaceful and contemplative had I not been surprised by how long it took.   * Several of my mother's caregivers, both nurses and aides, had moral or religious reservations about her decision. To their credit, they didn't just switch to the other side of the floor. They came to me, in tears, to say this was something their consciences would not permit. They visited her several times a day, but delegated the hands-on responsibilities to others. At the time, I admired their honesty and felt their hurt and love, but I wondered if this behavior was appropriate. Shouldn't they be able to leave their personal convictions at home?   The answer, I now know, is that they followed the canons of their profession perfectly: no health professional is required to participate if that violates a personal belief system. What they are required to do is ensure a smooth hand-off to someone equally qualified.   * During and after my mother's death, I was often stung by the implied or expressed judgments of friends, colleagues and even strangers after I wrote about the experience. ""You let your mother do that?,'' I was frequently asked, with the word ""let'' heavy with opprobrium. My answer, generally, was that it wasn't up to me. She was mentally competent and entitled to do as she pleased. My job as her daughter was to be supportive. Left unsaid, once I'd experienced the first episodes of shock and disapproval, was that I totally agreed with her. Expecting the reaction of others would have helped.   * Once my mother began her fast, the nursing home offered two ways to ensure her comfort. The regular staff could stay in place, keeping her mouth from getting too dry and administering sedatives as needed under the supervision of a palliative care physician. Or a team of hospice professionals, part of what was then a new collaboration with the nursing home, could take their places at the bedside. I opted for the familiar. My mother didn't warm easily to strangers, and I thought she would need the comfort of people she knew well.   A counselor like Ms. Schwarz would have told me that the regulars might ask to be taken off the case, which might have changed my mind. She also would have told me that a hospice team likely would medicate my mother more aggressively, given their training in cutting-edge comfort care. Even if I'd stuck to my plan and later wished I'd chosen hospice, Ms. Schwarz would have suggested a change of course. It never occurred to me that was possible. I was too tired to think straight.  * I have always assumed that what my mother chose to do herself, I could have insisted upon for her, as her health care proxy. In other words, if she were no longer ""decisionally capable,'' though not on the brink of death, I could have told the staff to stop spooning food into her mouth or bringing the straw to her lips, and they would have listened to me as her surrogate. Ms. Schwarz would have told me this isn't so. Other end-of-life experts are less certain but know of no test cases. From that I conclude that V.S.E.D. should be considered a viable option only for cognitively intact men and women. Maybe that's why it's called ""voluntarily stopping eating and drinking.''

Observations and reflections on the mother of all drinking holidays from Op-Extra contributors.,https://proof.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/blogs/30proof-notes-on55.html,Observations and reflections on the mother of all drinking holidays from Op-Extra contributors.,"Thoughts, recollections and a satirical cocktail recipe on the year's most alcohol-laden day, kindly offered by various Op-Extra contributors:   Suzanne Vega, Measure for Measure:   New Year's Eve and drinking. Sometimes they go together, but not always. I have spent many austere New Years Eves alone re-reading old diaries, making resolutions and not drinking, but I will admit those are not the most fun.   The most fun was in 1989 at a party given by the band They Might be Giants in Brooklyn. Still the best New Year's Eve party ever. Given in an apartment over a funeral parlor. I went with my sister and my then-boyfriend. We drank and danced. My boyfriend got mad and went home early. I stayed. I danced with my sister, and we stepped on the plug to the jukebox plunging the whole room into darkness and silence for a minute. What fun! Then she went home, then John Flansburg who was throwing the party went home. Then everybody else went home, and I was the last guest to leave. The sun came up gently as a car came to get me at 7 in the morning, and I said goodbye to John Linnell's sleepy, smiling face. What a nice memory. A lovely ride home over the Brooklyn Bridge.  The second most fun was New Year's Eve 1999. Remember Y2K? What a scam. I bought a black silk ball gown for the occasion in case the world fell apart that night. Seemed like the right thing to do. My sister and I went to my ex-boyfriend's house (the same man that had been my boyfriend 10 years before!) and we drank a lot and danced and had a lot of fun, until I sent her flying into the radiator under the window across the room. I let go of her hand by mistake. She hasn't danced with me since. She says it's because I always do the Hustle and date myself. Whatever. I still remember the snowflakes softly coming down at 5 am as I caught a cab home in my ball gown.  Well, none of us drink the way we used to since we lost our brother Tim to alcoholism at the age of 36. Lately when I go out with my husband on New Year's Eve, some of the nightlife looks scary. I watched someone who was so drunk she lay down in the crosswalk on Houston Street while her friends tried to get her on her feet before the traffic started up. I didn't watch to see what finally happened. I suppose moderation will be the key for me for this New Year's Eve, and that is O.K. with me.  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*  Glenn Eichler, Proof:   Recipe: ""The Blurry Zeitgeist""  3 parts Champagne  1 part vodka  1 part strawberry brandy  1 part smugness over past year's accomplishments   1 part regret over realizing past year's accomplishments were actually failures  1 part momentary burst of resolve followed immediately by 1 part deflating inertia  1 part nagging fear over possibility of … what was it again?  1 part self-congratulation over successfully keeping pre-New Year's resolution to avoid marketing exec neighbor at current party  1 part cautious optimism over Obama cabinet picks  1 part bitter disappointment over Obama cabinet picks  1 part utter disbelief at Caroline Kennedy  1 part inexplicable anxiety over not remembering what earlier nagging fear was about  1 part dawning awareness that marketing exec neighbor is approaching  1 part fleeting concern over possibly forgetting to TiVo ""The Biggest Loser""  1 part sinking realization that earlier nagging fear was about odds of contracting early-onset Alzheimer's  1 part self-pity over getting stuck conversing with marketing exec neighbor  1 part self-congratulation at not being marketing exec neighbor  1 part euphoric recollection of definitely remembering to TiVo ""The Biggest Loser,"" thus reducing likelihood of early-onset Alzheimer's  1 part self-loathing over TiVo full of ""The Biggest Loser""  Shake well and serve with metaphysical hangover.

I celebrate the New Year booze-free because I've long since quit drinking at all. But might I suggest to the majority of Americans who still do tipple -- especially on New Year's Eve -- that they consider passing the last holiday of the year stone cold sober as well? After all, this is nothing if not a time for considering new paradigms, and 24 hours spent in sober reflection on -- instead of Bacchanalian escape from -- what we should have learned in the previous year might be just the right way to bring in the new one. Especially this year, when we need desperately to remember that while we ignored history and allowed it to repeat itself, even amidst the rubble left by the Second Coming of the Great Depression, we somehow managed to make history too, by electing an African-American president. Both are matters of sufficient import to be recalled and appreciated in the absence of stupor.  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*   Peter Holsapple, Measure for Measure:   By the time I had moved from Los Angeles to New Orleans in 1993, probably the drinkingest city in America, my own alcohol problem was enormous. But I just thought I was having a lot of fun. The band I moved there with was a fine excuse to get together with five close friends, a case of beer, a few bottles of champagne and tequila, and make some music: New Orleans was a perfect destination to continue the party, which we did. After the band broke up, I moved upstairs from a bar I played at so the commute home wouldn't be quite so deadly.   My charmed life went on, immersed in boozing, unchecked by concerned friends or myself, escalating exponentially until I ended up charged with D.W.I. one night on the way home from a show where I had only drunk about three glasses of red wine. I spent a night in Orleans Parish lock-up in a room with 25 of my newest friends and a drain in the middle of the floor. The humiliation was more than I could stand. I drank cautiously a few more months, slowing to a crawl, until I decided that New Years' Eve 2001 would be the end of it.  I moved after Katrina washed my home and a lot of my past away, and I now live with my family in North Carolina, where I grew up. New Years' Eve now means breaking out a bottle of Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Cider and trying to stay up for the changing of the years, not always making it through, either.   Sometimes I think I miss the conviviality of hoisting a few with my fellows, but as I raise my glass nowadays, I toast the rebuilding of my shambolic life over seven years and look forward to the next 365 days, which will come at me one at a time. That, I can handle.  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;*   Darrell Brown,Measure for Measure:    I am an adult child of an alcoholic. There are a lot of us out there. I was never a drinker. My job in life was the designated driver, the designated shoulder to lean on, the designated superhero to clean up the mess whenever it was needed. I do have a very strong and benevolent shoulder I inherited from my mom.  Finally, last year before New Year's Eve, I made the long-delayed decision to let go of a few of my dearest addict friends. I was tired of feeling like the bad guy all the time. To paraphrase the song, I didn't have time for the pain anymore. Not in 2008. It was one of the hardest things I have ever done. It hurt. But that's what happens when you betray your own addictive behavior -- it rebels and squirms. I thought my heart would die.   A year has passed since then. I survived. I've healed some, and my health and sanity has returned. With this distance in place, I now feel I can again love these people who were so dear to me. I can look back with fondness and smile at the memories of most of our time together.   To another year of health.

"Patricia Nakache, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, is betting on start-ups that charge for Craigslist-type listings.",https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/blogs/11bits-paying-f1855.html,"Patricia Nakache, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, is betting on start-ups that charge for Craigslist-type listings.","UPDATED 3:30 p.m.: Added revenue and net income for LoopNet.  UPDATED 11/12 2:55 p.m. : Added clarification on screening process for caregivers on Care.com.   Craigslist offers listings for everything from apartments to lawyers to dates. It is free for users to search and in most cases, free for posters to put up their ads.    Patricia Nakache, a general partner at the venture capital firm, Trinity, is backing start-ups that figure people would be willing to pay for higher-quality, screened listings.  Because Craigslist does not much care about making money, it can be hard for a profit-driven business to compete. Just ask newspapers, which have seen their classified ads virtually disappear. But Ms. Nakache argues that ""people are willing to pay for a better experience.""   One of the companies in which she has invested is Care.com, a listing site for caregivers of all types, including nannies, senior care providers, tutors, housekeepers and pet sitters. Caregivers can post their information on the site for free. People searching for caregivers can view limited profiles for free but are charged $25 a month (with discounts for signing up for multiples months) to search full listings and contact providers.   People are willing to pay, Ms. Nakache said, because they find Craigslist, which does not vet listings, too risky for something as important as child or elder care. Care.com provides audio references and screens all profiles for red flags, such as a nanny who claims she has 10 years of experience but whose resume doesn't reflect that. Then, once someone wants to contact a caregiver, Care.com provides a free background check, verifying information like social security number and address and checking names against national criminal and sex offender databases. (If caregivers want to see their background checks before potential employers do, they can pay $8 to do so, but most do not, said Mark Crowley, spokesman for Care.com.)   The challenge, Ms. Nakache said, is how to add on to these services so users keep paying for subscriptions. Care.com includes articles on related topics, like how to deal with an elderly parent's Alzheimer's disease, what to pay baby sitters and how nannies should respond when their clients friend them on Facebook. Even after users find a caregiver and end their subscription, they often return to Care.com in the future, Ms. Nakache said, because their need for care changes over their lifetimes.   LoopNet, a commercial real estate listing site that is now a publicly traded company, is another Trinity investment that Ms. Nakache led. It lists $535 billion worth of commercial properties for sale, from offices to agricultural land and hotels. Its customers are individuals and commercial real estate firms and they pay to view and list properties. Subscriptions average $30 a month. LoopNet used to be free and make money from advertising, Ms. Nakache said, but switched to a subscription model after the tech bubble burst. The site had revenue of $71 million and net income of $21 million in 2007 and is now up to 3 million paying members.   Ms. Nakache has also invested in MyNewPlace, a home rental listing site that charges landlords a flat subscription fee or an $18 fee every time a potential renter contacts them, and Jobster, a job listing site that charges employers $99 for a 30-day listing or $10 for every applicant.   Start-ups and big companies have been trying to take on Craigslist for years. EBay, an investor in Craigslist, has Kijiji, a free classifieds site much like Craigslist. There are many other free and subscription apartment listing services and Web sites to help you find concert tickets, plumbers, nannies or whatever else you need. And there are always old-fashioned newspaper classified ads, which reigned before Craigslist arrived on the scene.   Ms. Nakache is betting that niche sites can prosper by charging for ads.

"To some medical researchers, no one ever dies of old age.",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/blogs/23newoldage-the-imme79.html,"To some medical researchers, no one ever dies of old age.","According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading causes of death among those ages 65 and over are, in descending order, heart disease, cancer, stroke, respiratory disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, influenza, kidney disease, accidents and infection.   Maybe so. But that's because people are not allowed to die of old age -- at least, old age cannot be listed as the cause of death on the official documents, according to both the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization, repositories of the world's mortality statistics.   Neither should ""infirmity'' or ""senescence'' appear as a cause of death, according to the C.D.C. handbook on how properly to fill out a death certificate. Why? These words ""have little value for public health or medical research,"" the agency says. Plus, ""Age is recorded elsewhere on the [death] certificate.''   (Photo: A sample death certificate and instructional text from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ""Physicians' Handbook on Medical Certification of Death."" (Jonathan Corum/The New York Times))   Instead, every death must be attributed to a single disease, which is the immediate cause of death. A second disease may be cited as the intermediate cause, and a third as the underlying condition. Even in situations ""when a number of conditions or multiple organ/system failure resulted in death,'' the C.D.C. instructs that ""the physician, medical examiner or coroner should choose...a clear and distinct etiological sequence,'' a ""chain of morbid events.''  It sounds orderly, doesn't it? But 80- and 90-year-olds don't usually die of one thing. Little by little, the wheels fall off the bicycle. The first few times, you patch everything up. But it's never quite the same. Each setback is a little worse than the last. Bad stuff happens more often. Eventually, as with all machines, the human body simply wears out.   In his remarkable bestseller ""How We Die,"" Sherwin Nuland rails at the ""soulless summary'' of the death certificate. He finds it ridiculous and dishonest that ""government statisticians and the scientific clinicians insist that proper names must be applied to sluggish circulation and an antique heart.''   To the C.D.C., a cause of death might be cardiac arrest, precipitated by a gastric hemorrhage, which in turn was the result of an ulcer. Or something more challenging to decode: a rupture of the myocardium caused by acute myocardial infarction, caused by coronary artery thrombosis and underlying atherosclerotic coronary heart disease.   But being old isn't the same as having a heart attack. Frail, weak, bedridden old people don't get cured, ever. ""To call a natural process by the name of a disease is the first step in an attempt to cure it and thereby thwart it,'' Dr. Nuland writes.   Plus, the ""biomedical world view'' distorts what actually happens. Veins and arteries stiffen and narrow. Less blood flows to the brain. Neurons die. Bones get brittle. Tiny strokes leave big deficits. Infections have their way once the immune system is shot. Sometimes all of the above happen, usually at least three.   When a person dies, calling the cause heart disease or pneumonia or osteoporosis or vascular dementia is both arbitrary and beside the point. In fact, everything stops working because the time is up. ""The thing that peters out,'' Dr. Nuland writes, ""is nothing other than the life force.""  What would it mean to medical science, I wonder, if death certificates did not describe us all as dying of something that could have been treated, and perhaps was, but instead of something inevitable and universally shared? Can we really pursue new treatments for heart disease or diabetes without also directly addressing their most frequent cause: age itself? And what would it mean for public policy if the leading cause of death among the very old was ""wheels falling off bicycle""? Would long-term care, its costs and indignities, find a place on the national agenda?   Dr. Nuland describes the very old in death as ""shrunken,'' and I can attest to that. My mother was tiny and crumpled, the light gone from her eyes. She died of old age, no matter what the death certificate says.

A public service advertisement about the impending transition from analog to digital TV is targeting the elderly.,https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/25/blogs/25newoldage-goodbye-53.html,A public service advertisement about the impending transition from analog to digital TV is targeting the elderly.,"Given the huge part that television plays in the daily lives of the elderly, it is no wonder that a public service advertisement about the impending transition from analog to digital TV is targeting this age group.   (Photo:  Will rabbit-ear TV antennae become collectors' items? (David Gray/Reuters))  The visual centerpiece of the ad is a white-haired woman with her old television set, rabbit-ears and all. She reminds viewers that come Feb. 17, 2009, sets like these will no longer work; nor will those that rely on over-the-air broadcast from a roof-top antenna.   Necessary instead will be either a digital-to-analog converter box, a subscription to cable or satellite TV or the purchase of a new television set with a digital tuner. [Note: As many readers have pointed out, particularly in reference to a misleading headline, any television without cable or satellite service will still require an antenna to pick up the signal, even with a converter box or digital tuner. The New Old Age thanks you all for the clarification.] For further information, see the transition Web site.   The white-haired woman in the public service advertisement is chirpy but -- no disrespect intended -- sounds to me like she hasn't a clue. Wouldn't this ad campaign be better directed at her adult children? Aren't they the ones likely to install the converter box, arrange cable service or buy their parents a new TV?   This reminds me of promises several years back, from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, that choosing the right Medicare drug plan would be a piece of cake for the 65-and-over set. All they had to do was sign on to the centers' Web site and use the handy Medicare Part D calculator. Punch in your list of medications, your local pharmacy and who-knows-what-else and -- Presto! -- the computer would spit out the ideal drug plan.   But what about elderly people who aren't computer literate? Or can't afford a computer? Or are blind from macular degeneration or demented from Alzheimer's disease? What if arthritis has gnarled their fingers or a stroke has left them paralyzed? What if the whole process just made them so anxious that they threw up their hands?   The lucky ones, like my colleague Gina Kolata's father, had adult children to choose a plan for them. And Ms. Kolata's account  of helping her dad made the process sound a good deal more difficult than the agency wanted anyone to believe.   So now we're warning the nation's 20 million households that rely on analog TVs with set-top or roof-top antennae that their days of television watching are numbered if they don't take action. The transition Web site even includes a countdown in days, hours, minutes and seconds. The site, and the rest of the consumer education campaign, is sponsored by business and industry groups, as well as civil rights organizations and those that advocate for the elderly, including AARP and the National Council on Aging.   All agree that the 20 million households without a digital TV or cable/satellite service are preponderantly elderly and often poor and uneducated. A quarter of those households are unaware of the impending change, according to Retirement Living TV, a cable network. The National Communications and Information Administration, part of the federal Department of Commerce, is offering coupons worth $40 -- two per household -- toward the purchase of converter boxes, which cost between $50 and $70.   In addition, AARP has a new online discussion group called ""How to Buy a Digital TV,'' the National Council on Aging  a ""digital donor program,'' and the National Institute of Senior Centers a training program for its member centers called ""Keeping Seniors Connected.'' All are commendable.   But if my mother were still alive, I'd mark my calendar and see to it she was good to go before the witching hour. Given her attachment to her rotary telephone, and her resistance to getting an answering machine -- which my brother bought, installed and maintained -- I surely wouldn't expect her to take care of the transition from analog to digital TV herself.   Nor would I dither until the day came when she couldn't watch her beloved Sunday morning talk shows. ""I'll take care of it next weekend, ma'' wouldn't do. Not when the television was her primary companion.

"Venerable New York Times reporter Edith Evans Asbury wrote in 1955 of the trials of the aged, a reminder of how little has changed.",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/blogs/10newoldage-nothing-91.html,"Venerable New York Times reporter Edith Evans Asbury wrote in 1955 of the trials of the aged, a reminder of how little has changed.","(Photo: Pioneering New York Times reporter Edith Evans Asbury at her apartment in 2006. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times))  For those of us of a certain age and gender at The New York Times, Edith Evans Asbury, who died on Oct. 30 at the age of 98, was a journalistic role model, and we read her obituary with sadness, admiration and an even deeper appreciation of her body of work than we already had.  I first met Edith in 1977, when she was 67 and just four years from retirement, and I was 30 and a newcomer to the paper. I recall her coronet of white braids, her modesty despite groundbreaking achievements dating back to 1929, and her generosity to those of us who followed in her footsteps.   Cited in her obituary was a highly-praised series on the problems of the elderly, written in 1955, which sent me back to the archives to see what had changed in the intervening years. There I found five stories, written before the advent of Medicare, before Alzheimer's disease became a household word and ""senility'' was blamed on hardening of the arteries, and before Ms. Asbury's routine use of the word ""oldsters'' would have been considered patronizing if not downright ageist.   But more remarkable than a few dated references was the overall sense that so little had changed since the series was written, that The New Old Age isn't so new after all.   ""Thanks to medical science, larger and larger numbers of men and women survive long past the Biblical 'three score and ten,'"" Ms. Asbury wrote in part one of the series (PDF), headlined ""Growing Ranks of the Aged Pose Grave Social Problem.'' Because of the ""physical and mental suffering'' that often comes with age, she continued, ""the 'gift' of longer life is more a punishment than a blessing.''   She noted other ""darker aspects'' of the increased lifespan -- 46 years at birth in 1900, 68 years as she wrote in 1955 and 78 years today. The families of the aged, Ms. Asbury said, ""increasingly stretched to the breaking point by the financial burden, hearts wrung by the slow physical and mental crumbling of a beloved parent or grandparent, also pay heavily. And the enormous drain on public funds threatens to strike deep into the taxpayer's pocket.''  Part two of the series, entitled ""Care Inadequate for the Sick Aged,'' (PDF) recounted the special plight of the senile elderly, whose needs were so great that the rest of the family was often ""blown apart.'' The cost of keeping them at home was ""utterly beyond the means of the average self-supporting middle income family,'' who found it ""virtually impossible to solve the problem of long term custodial care for a senile relative in a way commensurate with its pride and dignity.'' But these forgetful, wandering, childlike elderly were largely unwelcome in nursing homes or hospitals because of the disruption they caused other patients and thus generally wound up in mental hospitals, labeled psychotic as well as senile.   The only families spared this outcome, Ms. Asbury wrote in the series' third installment, ""Rise in Aged Adds Burdens on Young,'' (PDF) were the wealthy, who could hire companions or nurses at home or pay for expensive institutional care, and the indigent, the equivalent of today's Medicaid-eligible. Those ""welfare cases were handled by public agencies,'' Ms. Asbury explained, and entitled to many free services, including visiting nurses and homemakers, intensive case management and placement in ""boarding homes,'' which were limited to four residents with round-the-clock supervision.  Part four of the series, ""Aids to Morale Needed for Aged,'' (PDF) and part five, ""Europe Leads U.S. in Assisting Aged,"" (PDF) dealt with the downside of mandatory retirement in this country, where employment advertisements could still legally seek out candidates under age 40, and the upside of socialized medicine, subsidized housing and other financial benefits for the elderly in places like Germany and Scandinavia.   Throughout the series, Ms. Asbury cited the growing numbers of old people: In 1955, 1 in 12 Americans were age 65 or older, representing 8 percent of the population, up from 3 percent in 1900. But experts were already ""quaking at the prospects of the future,'' she wrote. ""One need not be an Einstein to deduce from these statistics, and from the rate of speed at which medical science achieves new victories over disease, that the aged are destined to form a much larger proportion of the population than they do now.''  And so they have.   Today, 13 percent of Americans are 65 or older. By the year 2030, according to Census Bureau projections, when all the baby boomers have turned 65, more than 20 percent of Americans will be in that age group. By 2050, their numbers will have reached 89 million, more than double the number today.   Compare that to the 12 million ""oldsters,'' as Ms. Asbury called them in 1955, when she wrote her prescient series. It should have been a call to action rather than a reminder all these years later that there is nothing new under the sun.

"Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has dementia, her daughter says. Is it right to discuss her condition publicly?",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/blogs/02newoldage-margaret59.html,"Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has dementia, her daughter says. Is it right to discuss her condition publicly?","A colleague in The Times's London bureau, Sarah Lyall, has just published a book called ""The Anglo Files: A Field Guide to the British,'' a cross-cultural look at what makes the British British, as seen though the eyes of an American expatriate with an English husband whom she describes as ""something out of 'Brideshead Revisited'.'' Given Ms. Lyall's perspective, I asked her thoughts on the recent revelation that former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, like President Ronald Reagan before her, is losing her mind and her memories to a form of dementia. Here are her observations, with a link to the story that is striking a chord on both sides of the Atlantic. -- Jane Gross  (Photo: President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1984. Mrs. Thatcher's daughter recently has been criticized for publicly discussing her mother's dementia. (Associated Press))   In Britain, it has long been an open secret that former prime minister Margaret Thatcher has been sliding into dementia. ""Open"" because old friends and political allies can all see the changes in the proud woman known as the Iron Lady, particularly since she suffered a series of mini-strokes in 2002 and withdrew from public speaking on her doctors' advice. And ""secret"" because no one has spoken publicly about it.   Until now. Last month her daughter, Carol Thatcher, revealed all to a newspaper, The Mail on Sunday. In an excerpt from her forthcoming memoir, ""A Swim-On Part in the Goldfish Bowl,"" Carol Thatcher not only announced that her mother, now 82, is suffering from dementia but offered excruciating evidence.   Sometimes Mrs. Thatcher forgets what she has eaten for breakfast, her daughter wrote. Once she conflated the Falklands War with the Bosnian conflict. Cruelly, she has had to be reminded repeatedly that her beloved husband, Denis, is dead. (He died in 2003.)  Carol Thatcher's heartbreak at seeing her formidable mother reduced to a confused old woman is all too familiar to anyone caring for a friend or relative suffering a similar fate. But Mrs. Thatcher is an iconic and larger-than-life figure -- ""far more than the sum of her parts,"" Vanessa Feltz wrote in the Daily Express -- and Britain is still a country where privacy, particularly in matters of health, is valued. Many people have reacted angrily to Carol Thatcher's disclosures.   In The Daily Telegraph, Andrew Pierce noted that Mrs. Thatcher's friends had purposely kept silent, in order to ""preserve the great lady's dignity and grace in a quiet, discreet way."" In The Daily Express, Anne Widdecombe, a Tory M.P., said, ""The only consolation, perhaps, is that Margaret Thatcher almost certainly does not know what her daughter has done."" And in The Sun, Kelvin MacKenzie raised the issue of who owns the reputation of a public figure like Mrs. Thatcher -- her family or the wider world?   ""My question is: why did Carol think it right to reveal her mother's plight, especially when none of her political friends had ever done so even in their political books?"" he asked. ""I can only conclude it was done for money. I hope she feels proud of herself."" And across the Atlantic, Ronald Reagan Jr. -- whose father publicly announced at age 82 that he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease -- called Carol Thatcher's detailed account ""in monumentally bad taste and unnecessary.""   But the debate doesn't end there.   On the one hand, it does seem to violate a proud woman's privacy to describe the sad diminishment of her formidable powers, particularly when she doesn't seem capable -- as President Reagan was -- of making the disclosures herself. On the other hand, it makes her poignantly human. Many of our parents will, in the end, suffer what she is suffering; many of us will, too, when our turn comes.   So why the secrecy and shame? Many people who have written to the British papers and posted on various Web sites have made robust arguments for speaking openly about one of the great taboos of our time. As a friend of mine put it, ""If you refuse to talk about it, you're treating it as something shameful,"" once the common response to cancer.   My friend is acquainted with a 71-year-old woman whose mind is slipping. Her husband knows it; her acquaintances know it; she herself knows it on some level, despite her doctor's euphemistic diagnosis. She anxiously asks whether she is repeating things (she is) and frets that she is forgetting what she used to remember (she is).   But she refuses to confront the obvious, and her friends have all been forced to join this conspiracy of silence. This means there is a lot of speculating and gossiping about her condition. How bad is it? Can we bring it up with her husband? What plans is she making for the future? At the same time, there is no real chance to acknowledge the reality or commiserate with the family's pain.

"Washington State joined Oregon in legalizing physician-assisted suicide, but for terminal patients and their doctors the questions are growing more difficult.",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/06/blogs/06newoldage-at-the-e95.html,"Washington State joined Oregon in legalizing physician-assisted suicide, but for terminal patients and their doctors the questions are growing more difficult.","(Photo: (Ron Koeberer/Aurora))   On Tuesday, Washington State joined Oregon as the second in the nation where physicians are allowed to prescribe lethal doses of medication to terminally ill men and women who want to hasten their own deaths. But the remedies available to suffering patients have expanded dramatically in the 11 years since the Oregon measure took effect, one expert recently noted, and the question of whether doctors should help patients die is far more nuanced than it once was.   The Washington State proposition, Initiative 1000 (PDF), passed by a margin of 59 to 41 percent, and like the Oregon measure, which withstood several legal challenges, contains many safeguards intended to prevent hasty and ill-considered decisions. Patients requesting this assistance must be mentally competent, residents of the state, have six months or less to live according to two physicians, wait 15 days after their initial request and then repeat that request both orally and in writing. They must be capable of administering the lethal medication themselves and agree to counseling if their physicians request it. In addition, these patients also must be informed by their health care providers of other feasible alternatives.   In the view of Dr. Timothy E. Quill, director of the palliative care program at the University of Rochester, these options have expanded and gained acceptance in medical circles over the past decade. In 1997, in two important cases (Dr. Quill was a plaintiff in one), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled there was no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide and upheld a prohibition against it. But in the same ruling, the justices conceded that terminally ill patients are entitled to aggressive pain management, even if high doses of opiates or barbiturates have the ""double effect'' of hastening death.   That seemed a footnote at the time to the larger issue, but it arguably cracked open the door to those other feasible options, which Dr. Quill and other end-of-life experts refer to as ""last resorts"" in jurisdictions where it is a crime for physicians to assist in dying.  Dr. Quill's views on physician-assisted death -- a term preferred by many palliative care doctors and right-to-die organizations -- are outlined in two essays published by the Hastings Center, the nation's oldest bioethics research institute. One, entitled ""Physician-Assisted Death in the United States: Are the Existing 'Last Resorts' Enough?'' appeared in the center's bimonthly report this fall. The other, intended to be a resource for policymakers, political candidates and journalists, is one of 36 topics framed and amplified in the center's more recent ""Bioethics Briefing Book.""  In these articles, Dr. Quill enumerated ""last resort'' options in the order he advises they be considered, both because of what is involved in each practice and because of the degree of acceptance among ethicists, legal experts and the general public. The essays were written, obviously, before the voting in Washington State. Dr. Quill considered it ""a good time to review areas of progress in palliative and end-of-life care and consider whether [laws or ballot measures of this type] are either necessary or desirable.""   He concluded with a cautious ""yes"" but makes a compelling case that adding physician-assisted death to the repertoire is not, for him, the singular solution it was when he made history by publishing an account in a medical journal about his own role in a patient's death.  First and foremost, Dr. Quill and others say, all terminally ill patients should have access to state-of-the art palliative care, both to relieve pain and other symptoms and to provide emotional support to patients and families. Often delivered as part of hospice, palliative care has come of age in the last decade: it is now a board-certified sub-specialty, Dr. Quill noted, offered in a growing number of teaching and community hospitals.   Dr. Quill recommended that a palliative care consultation be mandatory before anyone considers the following ""last resorts,"" which he listed from least controversial to most:    1. In the rare cases where pain and suffering remain intractable, despite top-notch palliative care, the next option should be pain management so aggressive that it may well hasten death, although that is not the primary intention. This is the doctrine of ""double effect,"" articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in 1997 and relatively uncontroversial.      2. Rarely challenged, too, is a patient's right to forgo life-sustaining therapies or discontinue them once begun. This likely would include feeding tubes, ventilators and other life-support machinery. But it could also include chemotherapy, blood pressure medication, insulin or garden-variety antibiotics. The legal and ethical argument here is that we all have the right to autonomy and bodily integrity, and to control what is done or not done to us.       3. Also considered by some to be a matter of bodily integrity is V.S.E.D., short for ""voluntarily stopping eating and drinking."" Dr. Quill believes this is ""more morally complex'' choice than the second option, because over the last decade the practice has expanded beyond those with end-stage cancer or Alzheimer's disease -- who often lose interest in food or forget how to eat and drink -- to people who are not ""actively dying'' but nevertheless have had enough of disability or dependence. V.S.E.D. requires ""considerable resolve,'' Dr. Quill said, because thirst can be persistent and death can take as long as three weeks. Physicians do not ""assist'' these patients but support them with symptom relief for dry mouth or sedation in the event of delirium or other complicating discomforts.       4. The ""last, last resort,'' and by far the most controversial of the legal methods, is sedation to the point of unconsciousness, also known as palliative or terminal sedation. Endorsed earlier this year by the American Medical Association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, it involves an explicit decision to render a patient unconscious if pain can be controlled no other way. Food and fluid may be discontinued, and in one to three days the patient dies of dehydration.     According to data from Oregon, 341 people have died in 11 years as a result of lethal doses of medication provided by a physician. That amounts to 1 in 1,000 deaths overall per year, according to the state health department, although 1 in 50 dying patients have discussed the possibility with their doctors and one in six with their families. ""Most patients will be reassured by the possibility of an escape,'' Dr. Quill said, ""and will never need to activate that escape.''   By contrast, when physician-assisted death is a covert operation, far more people seem to grab the chance. Data on this secret but apparently widespread practice is hard to collect, because physicians can be charged and prosecuted for a crime. But in the mid-1990s a team of researchers, Dr. Quill among them, tried to investigate the question using techniques that protected anonymity. The researchers found that between 1 and 2 percent of deaths per year had been aided, illegally, by physicians through assisted suicide or euthanasia -- 10 to 20 times the rate observed in Oregon since legalization of this practice.

"Unable to accept new Medicare patients, a physician in Chicago resorts to a new kind of geriatric assessment. Is this the future of care for the elderly?",https://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/blogs/16newoldage-when-med75.html,"Unable to accept new Medicare patients, a physician in Chicago resorts to a new kind of geriatric assessment. Is this the future of care for the elderly?","(Photo: Dr. Cheryl Woodson, a geriatrician in Chicago Heights, Ill., attends to patient Adeline Robinson, who is in her 90s. Dr. Woodson says she can no longer afford to accept new patients on Medicare. (Sally Ryan for The New York Times))    For Dr. Cheryl E. Woodson, geriatric medicine is a passion that doesn't pay the bills.   ""I love this. I just love this,'' she said one recent afternoon in her office in Chicago Heights, Ill. Dr. Woodson had just diagnosed early-stage dementia in a 73-year-old patient, recommending a hip replacement while the woman is still cognitively capable of rehabilitation, and then had consoled the woman's weeping daughter.   But Dr. Woodson can no longer afford to run her solo practice as she once did. She has stopped taking new patients over the age of 65, when Medicare kicks in, since reimbursement for their care is now ""40 cents on the dollar,'' she said, not enough to staff her office and pay the rent.   ""If I take new Medicare patients, I can't keep the door open,'' Dr. Woodson said. With Medicare paying less now then it did in 2001, she added, ""you can serve seniors or feed your children."" Not both.  Dr. Woodson's dilemma is shared by many internists and family practitioners, endangered specialists in a health care system that pays for procedures and tests but not for the time-consuming management of chronic conditions. ""We get paid to do things to people, not for people,'' Dr. Woodson is fond of saying.   This is especially true for the elderly, who are generally not good candidates for we-can-fix-it medicine. Instead, as they lose mobility, cognition and thus independence, they require lengthy office visits, close monitoring and supportive services. These days, it is difficult to find a new doctor for anyone over the age of 65, because they are so expensive to treat.   Dr. Woodson's solution to the cash crunch is to keep her existing elderly patients and to turn away new ones. At the same time, however, she has begun providing geriatric consultations, much like a cardiologist or orthopedist might. Each Wednesday afternoon, she does three such consultations, each at least an hour long, which produce what she calls a ""level-of-care prescription'' that the primary-care physician and family can implement on their own.   The goal of the assessment is to determine what's wrong with the elderly patient, whether it can be fixed and how to manage things if it can't be, which is often the case. Each appraisal details the patient's overall health status and involves a review of current medications, level of independence, mobility, behavior and memory.   From that assessment comes a recommendation of what services are needed, who can deliver them and where that is best accomplished: at home, in a retirement facility or in a nursing home. That determination is not based soley on a patient's condition, but also on how much hands-on care family members are willing and able to provide and how much hired help they can afford. Often the evaluation is followed by a family meeting, with Dr. Woodson as referee.   One recent Wednesday, I observed as Dr. Woodson performed two office assessments and convened a family meeting via conference call. It is not as satisfying as an all-geriatric practice, she told me, and some of the consultation patients wish they could stay. But a little geriatrics is better than none at all, and this approach could be the wave of the future.  The first assessment involved a 79-year-old woman with dementia so advanced she was unable to answer the doctor's questions or follow her instructions during a cognitive exam, rearranging the contents of her purse instead of drawing a clock with its hands at 11:10, as Dr. Woodson had gently requested. When asked to spell the word ""world"" both forward and backward, the patient declared, ""I really have to go now.''  The woman, who lives in a facility for those with Alzheimer's disease, was taking a cornucopia of medications likely to exacerbate her confusion and increase the odds of a serious fall. Dr. Woodson later suggested altering the regime. She also advised the woman's stepdaughters against any tests or procedures designed to prolong the patient's life rather than improve its quality. The patient's severe neck pain was likely the result of arthritis, Dr. Woodson said, and nothing could be done for it but pain medication and heat. So why subject her to a M.R.I.?   The second assessment involved a 73-year-old woman with subtle signs of dementia noticeable only to a professional or a close family member. She also was suffering from necrosis of the hip and rated the pain as 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. Dr. Woodson adjusted the length of the woman's cane, confirmed her daughter's fear that some recent erratic behavior was consistent with very early dementia, and urged hip surgery to relieve the pain while the patient could still follow the directions of a physical therapist.   The phone consultation involved an 87-year-old woman at an assisted living facility whose health was in steep decline. Now she needed services not included in her monthly rent: someone to dispense medication four times a day, help her into compression stockings each morning to reduce swelling in her legs, provide three treatments a day with a nebulizer to facilitate her breathing and accompany her to numerous doctors' appointments. At the moment, the woman's daughter, who had a job and family, was doing all of this and more.   One alternative, Dr. Woodson told the woman's son, was to hire private-duty health aides and a geriatric care manager to take some of the burden off his sister. The other was to move his mother to a nursing home, where a 24/7 staff would either do or arrange everything. The son was resistant to the first because of the expense and to the second because he preferred the beautiful setting at the assisted living facility to the hospital-like environment of a nursing home.   The call ended without a resolution. ""I'm not sure he understands there is no level of care between assisted living and a nursing home,'' Dr. Woodson said later. ""As his mother's condition worsens, they are going to need more and more services. One person can't handle this, and I think he's only giving only lip service to the amount of work his sister is doing.''  How I would have loved hearing this kind of medical advice when my mother's needs exceeded what an assisted living facility could deliver or when there was conflict between me and my brother. I was too ignorant to look for a geriatrician and in any event probably wouldn't have been able to find one, given the crisis of supply and demand. But even locating a plain-vanilla internist willing to take a new Medicare patient was an ordeal. Everyone we called said his practice was full. Finally, my brother's physician persuaded his sister, also a doctor, to see my mother. I don't know what we would have done otherwise.  Have any of you or your loved ones been turned away by physicians unwilling to take on new Medicare patients? Please share your stories -- and if you have any, solutions. The problem will only grow as those of us in our 60s outlive our current doctors or relocate and need to find new ones.

Since 1969, this pre-eminent bioethics research center has focused on such issues as care and decision making at the end of life, public health priorities and emerging technologies. I hope that many of the scholars I met there will contribute to this blog, beginning with co-founder Daniel Callahan.  Dr. Callahan wrote the essay below at my request, following a provocative conversation about his long-standing -- and controversial -- support for rationing health care for the elderly. He views rationing as a way of keeping Medicare solvent in an era of more and more old people, more and more advancements in high-tech medical care, and more and more confidence that age is no barrier to successful heart surgery, cancer treatment and the like.  ""The biggest change in the last 40 years,'' Mr. Callahan said to me, ""is that there are no limits. There's nothing we can't do for an old person, and there's a lot of pressure to do it. This is considered progress, and it's considered ageism to be skeptical. But we can't go on this way. It's unaffordable. And it's the hardest dilemma in our society because there's no good way to deal with it other than saying 'no.'''   Mr. Callahan's essay follows. He and I welcome your comments and your questions.   (Photo: Daniel Callahan, co-founder of the Hastings Center in Garrison, N.Y. )   The Economic Woes of Medicare  By Daniel Callahan  Here's how I got into trouble. In 1987, I published a book called ""Setting Limits: Medical Goals in An Aging Society."" The costs of the Medicare program were rising rapidly, heavily driven by medical technology. Eventually, I argued, spending limits would have to be set. The best way to do so would be to use age as a cutoff point for the most expensive technologies, even those, like open-heart surgery, that might be lifesaving. About 80 was my suggested year to draw the line.  That proposal was notably unpopular, disliked by everyone, excoriated by many. The least of the charges was that I was an ageist, a cold-hearted young person who knew nothing about old age (I was 56 at the time). Yes, many people and aging experts agreed, there was a pending cost crisis, but there were far less draconian ways to deal with it: more research to cure the diseases of aging, a more efficient health care system, better assessment of technology to get rid of wasteful and useless treatment, and far more widespread use of living wills.   Two decades have now passed, and not one of those solutions (which I call smiley-faced) has made much difference. The Medicare program cost $429 billion in 2007 and, with a 7 percent annual cost increase, will rise to $884 billion in 2017. At that point, the Trustees of the program have told us, it will in effect be bankrupt.   In the meantime, as every beneficiary of the program knows, the economic screws are tightening. The average recipient has to spend $5,000 (and sometimes up to $10,000) for medical costs not covered by the program. It is getting harder and harder to find primary care physicians to care for the old, and many doctors, poorly reimbursed, are reluctant to take the elderly on as patients. Integrated care for the chronically ill is usually lacking. Out-of-pocket costs and increased co-payments for drugs will surely follow projected 2009 jumps of 31 percent to 60 percent in drug plan premiums.  Recipients, then, are in trouble, but hardly less so than the program itself. While the gradual increase in the number and proportion of the elderly has so far not raised costs, it will make a great difference within the next few years as the baby boom generation begins to retire. At the same time, there is an increasing array of new drugs and technologies keeping the elderly alive in ways hardly imaginable a few decades ago. One recent study concluded that, even with Medicare, a couple retiring at 65 would need $225,000 in savings to cover their medical costs in retirement.  Old age itself, once a reason to deny care, is rarely a barrier any longer. The average age of those undergoing heart surgery, organ transplantation, kidney dialysis and advanced cancer treatment steadily rises. The headline of a story in The New York Times on November 11, "" Good Survival Rates Found in Heart Surgery for Aged,"" tells that story. So does another, on July 18, titled ""Rise Seen in Medical Efforts to Treat the Very Old."" Medical research has found no decisive cures for the diseases of aging, but it has found myriad ways of keeping sick and frail people alive longer and longer. Unfortunately, that success -- if anyone wants to call it that -- increases the odds for Alzheimer's. Something or other will get us in the long run, but a great deal of money can be spent getting us there.  There are in the end only two decisive ways to control Medicare costs: raise taxes, cut benefits, or both. Neither political party is game to raise taxes, for Medicare or anything else. As for cutting benefits, Congress this year voted for $20 billion in new expenditures, ignoring the need for frugality.  Yet there is nothing of importance left to do other than to reduce benefits. That move would mean denying elderly patients both what they might want and need. Or are there some less draconian alternatives? A long-standing refrain of many older people is that much money could be saved if they were more easily free -- by living wills or the appointment of surrogates -- to turn down expensive life-prolonging measures of dubious benefit. Maybe so, but some studies have shown that would not make much economic difference in an overall Medicare budget of hundreds of billions.   More important, despite what they say in advance, many elderly people will in fact choose to be aggressively treated for a critical illness even when there is a good chance it will not save them -- but just might. Doctors endlessly complain to me that excessive patient expectations of medical miracles, or those of their family members, make it harder, not easier, these days to curtail aggressive treatment. Not all of us can resist the lure of a slightly longer life, despite what we may have said in advance.   Other reforms have been proposed. There are enormous and inexplicable regional variations in Medicare costs for patients at the end of life and in many other situations also. The most costly regions get no better health outcomes than the least costly. That could be changed, but it would probably require a government-regulated health care system to pull it off (which would be fine with me). Better assessment of expensive technologies could make a great difference as well, but Congress has persistently refused to allow Medicare to take costs into account in its coverage decisions. A recent federal court decision blocked administration efforts to save money by paying only for the least expensive treatments for some conditions. Will Congress, with the support of the Obama administration, allow Medicare to consider cost in the future? That reform would be one good test of its reform seriousness.  So here I am, 20 years after publishing ""Setting Limits,"" now age 78. Many of my earlier readers predicted that I would change my tune about age-based rationing when I became old. I concede that age-based rationing will not be accepted. But I doggedly believe we will one way or the other have to set limits on health care for the elderly, even if a specific age limit will not do. The underlying premise of my 1986 book was that a good society ought to help young people become old people, but is under no obligation to help the old become indefinitely older. The latter is a fiscal black hole, abetted by endless new and costly technologies. It is the quality of life in old age, not its length, that should be the goal of Medicare.  Our society can not, and should not, promise open-ended, progress-driven medical care that is indifferent to costs. In that respect, age does matter, and that reality should not be evaded. It will take some as yet undeveloped combination of age and other considerations -- including, for example, cost, possibility of benefit, and patient desires -- to find an acceptable way of setting limits. Almost anyone can think of hypothetical win-win solutions to the problem. They are unlikely to work.

On July 10, 1943, he stumbled ashore, pistol drawn, in the Allied invasion of Sicily and went on to fight in the Italian campaign while turning the raw material of the front into captioned panel cartoons, often at the expense of superiors in the rear.

Last week Marki Flannery, the president of Partners in Care, an affiliate of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, discussed the advantages of hiring a home health aide from an agency. This week she picks up where she left off, answering questions about the costs of home health aides, the intimate strangers who often make it possible for our parents to remain in their homes, even when they need help or supervision day and night.   (Photo: Marki Flannery of Partners in Care. (Janet Charles))   Q. What does it cost to hire round-the-clock help, and what is the most economical way to do it?   A. When it comes to needing care 24/7, the first thing you have to do is define exactly what level of care you need. Does your mom need a home health aide to monitor her all day and all night, or do you need a home health aide for your mom only when she is awake?  We will help you figure out what you need by asking how well your mom sleeps at night; how many times she gets up; what her sleeping patterns are. We will also figure out with you if the home environment has a suitable place for the home health aide to sleep, and if the aide who is ""living-in"" will be able to get some hours of uninterrupted sleep and a couple of hours a day ""off-duty.""   If you want a ""live-in"" home health aide who will be in the home 24 hours a day, but who will have time off to sleep and for personal time, then we suggest two aides to cover the seven days in a week -- one who works for four days and another who works the remaining three days.   This shared approach keeps the cost to you as low as possible, because when one aide works more than 40 hours during a seven-day week, we are required by law to pay that aide additional money for each hour worked over 40.   So, here is how the math works:  We charge you for one aide working three days at 14 hours per day, for a total of 42 hours. Forty hours are charged at our hourly rate (currently $18.50 in New York City), and two hours are charged at the overtime rate (currently $23.05) and, we charge you for the other aide working four days at 14 hours per day for a total of 56 hours, with 40 hours being charged at our hourly rate and 16 hours charged at the overtime rate. Thus, a week of round-the-clock help costs $1,894.90.   Of course you could request that one aide work more than four days in a row, but then the costs increase. Or, you could increase the number of aides and have each aide work just 40 hours per week or less, but then you have more aides working for you.  There are times, however, when two aides simply can't cover the full seven-day week. If your mom truly needs the aide to be awake every hour of the day, we assign two aides to each 24-hour period, one working from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and the second working the 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. shift. In this case, to cover the full week, we would assign four aides. Two of them would exceed the 40 hours per week limit, each having to work 48 hours during the week. So, you would have a total of 16 hours charged at the overtime rate. In this scenario, a week of care costs $3,328.80.   These options get you the care you need from a licensed home health care agency at the lowest possible cost and keep the number of home health aides as low as possible. Other options can be worked out but likely will result in increasing the number of aides working for you.   Q. How much money does your average aide make, and what benefits do you offer, compared to the industry at large?   A. We pay our home health aides by the hour, on a graduated scale. That means that the hourly pay rate increases the longer a home health aide works for us. Entry level aides earn $8 per hour, and aides who have worked with us for a few years or more earn up to $13 per hour. According to published information, the national average wage for home health aides is $9.11 per hour. Our average wage is higher.   You may be wondering why we charge you more than the hourly rate we pay our home health aides, and the answer lies in the support we provide to our employees. All of our aides are eligible for individual health benefits, including vision, dental and prescription drug coverage, at no cost to them. We also offer our aides pension benefits, paid vacations and sick time, and we provide uniforms as well.   In addition, all of our aides are offered continuing education and have career advancement opportunities. While we have many home health aides who never want to stop going to people's homes and helping them live a better life, we also have aides who move up the career ladder to become nurses, supervisors and managers. And of course, there are the usual business expenses, including rent, insurance, recruitment, equipment, staff to oversee the care provided and administrative staff.  All of these things account for our success in keeping home health aides working with us for years. There is a lot of turnover in our industry, and we see it, too. But estimates put the national average at 40 percent to 60 percent, and, year-after-year, we see a turnover rate of less than half the national average. We celebrated our 25th anniversary in 2008 and are very proud of the fact that we have 12 home health aides who have been with us for every one of those years. We have 27 aides who have worked with us for 20 years, another 33 who have 15 years of service, 112 with 10 years and more than 2,100 who have been here at least five years.   Q. Home health aides from licensed agencies must follow certain rules that restricts what they can do. Why is this so?   A. The rules and regulations that govern what a certified home health aide can and can't do exist primarily to protect the patient and family. People may choose to hire an unlicensed individual and not have to follow the New York State rules and regulations but then, as I have suggested before, the risk factor is likely to increase in any number of ways.   We recently took on the case of a patient whose family had first hired someone recommended to them by a neighbor. This person, not certified and not trained, used the wrong dressing on an open wound, causing considerable harm and pain to the patient. This mistake is far less likely to happen with a certified home health aide. If the patient had been with us from the beginning, the proper treatment would have been prescribed by the doctor and managed by the nurse in cooperation with the patient's physician, and the aide would have received proper instruction about what needed to be done.  In another case, an adult daughter called us after her mom, who suffered from both Alzheimer's and congestive heart failure, was admitted to the hospital as a result of an adverse reaction to medications. The daughter had initially hired a person to be with her mom at home and give her the medications she needed. As the mother's medical condition deteriorated, her medication routine became more complex. Unfortunately, the multiple medications didn't work well together, and her mom had to be hospitalized. The person hired by the woman's daughter could not explain to the doctors exactly what meds she had given to the patient and when they were administered. While certified home health aides in New York State can give medications to most patients, they cannot administer medications to patients who are not aware of what they are taking and why, but nurses can. So in this case, we would have provided both an aide and a nurse, ensuring the medications would be properly administered.  We sometimes hear from people that hired a trustworthy person on their own, because he or she can do the food shopping for an elderly parent while a certified home health aide from a licensed agency can't. Not true. At Partners in Care, we handle grocery shopping for patients all the time, but we do so using a system of checks and balances to ensure that our client's money is spent on what they want. If the patient wants us to use cash, we put a limit on how much. We also require our aide to keep the receipts and, of course, return the change. We won't allow our aides to use a patient's debit or credit card or PIN number. Most often, we use the online credit card purchasing systems available in a market, such as Fresh Direct, and use home delivery.   Another concern we hear goes like this: ""I want someone who will pick up my mom after she falls, not leave her on the floor until emergency medical services arrives. And a certified home health aide won't do that."" Well, this concern is true. A certified home health aide is taught that there is greater risk in lifting or moving an elderly person who has fallen than there is in waiting for the appropriate medical team to arrive. At the same time, a professionally trained aide can usually differentiate a minor fall from a more serious fall that requires professional medical assistance.

Fifteen film actors whose performances in 2007 marked a career-defining moment — and set them above the rest.,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/magazine/10Oscars-t.html,Fifteen film actors whose performances in 2007 marked a career-defining moment — and set them above the rest.," In 2005, at the Sundance Film Festival, a star was born, but almost no one noticed. Well, actually, a few studio executives who saw “Hard Candy” raved about the performance of the unknown Ellen Page  she played an avenging, psychopathic 14-year-old who entices and then violently tortures a would-be pedophile. But the movie was so relentlessly disturbing (at one point, Page’s character ties her enemy down and slowly begins to castrate him) that when “Hard Candy” was released the following year, no one went to see it. What the audience missed then is what they later found in “Juno”  the birth of a different sort of actress. Unlike her glamour-girl peers who double as tabloid superstars, Page, who is now 20, is a tomboy  her on-screen persona is sharp, clear-eyed, determined and self-consciously original. In “Hard Candy,” she managed to be adorable and persuasive while wielding a large knife; in 2007, that same spirit and charm animated “Juno,” a kind of fairy tale about a pregnant 16-year-old who decides to have the baby and give it to the couple (in the end, half the couple) she chooses. In “Juno,” the lack of realism  no one questions Juno’s decision  and the lack of politics are trumped by the overwhelming appeal of Page’s acting. She is so alive on screen  so unique, so ingratiating  that she makes the character, and the entire film, believable.",MM,51,The New York Times,"[{'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'xlarge', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2008/02/08/magazine/10Oscars.600.jpg', 'height': 171, 'width': 600, 'legacy': {'xlarge': 'images/2008/02/08/magazine/10Oscars.600.jpg', 'xlargewidth': 600, 'xlargeheight': 171}, 'subType': 'xlarge', 'crop_name': 'articleLarge'}, {'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'popup', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2008/02/08/magazine/10Oscars.600.jpg', 'height': 171, 'width': 600, 'legacy': {}, 'subType': 'popup', 'crop_name': 'popup'}, {'rank': 0, 'subtype': 'thumbnail', 'caption': None, 'credit': None, 'type': 'image', 'url': 'images/2008/02/08/magazine/10Oscars.75.75.jpg', 'height': 75, 'width': 75, 'legacy': {'thumbnail': 'images/2008/02/08/magazine/10Oscars.75.75.jpg', 'thumbnailwidth': 75, 'thumbnailheight': 75}, 'subType': 'thumbnail', 'crop_name': 'thumbStandard'}]","[{'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Academy Awards (Oscars)', 'rank': 1, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'Actors and Actresses', 'rank': 2, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Page, Ellen', 'rank': 3, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Rogen, Seth', 'rank': 4, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Cera, Michael', 'rank': 5, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Leigh, Jennifer Jason', 'rank': 6, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Ryan, Amy', 'rank': 7, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Brolin, Josh', 'rank': 8, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'McAvoy, James', 'rank': 9, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Sturgess, Jim', 'rank': 10, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Cotillard, Marion', 'rank': 11, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Dano, Paul', 'rank': 12, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Holbrook, Hal', 'rank': 13, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Christie, Julie', 'rank': 14, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Affleck, Casey', 'rank': 15, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Miller, Sienna', 'rank': 16, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'Paltrow, Jake', 'rank': 17, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'persons', 'value': 'McGinley, Ryan', 'rank': 18, 'major': 'N'}, {'name': 'subject', 'value': 'MOTION PICTURES', 'rank': 19, 'major': 'N'}]",2008-02-10T05:00:00+0000,article,Magazine,Magazine,News,nyt://article/966ff509-38bf-57a4-834c-b441c7985fc7,3212,nyt://article/966ff509-38bf-57a4-834c-b441c7985fc7,Breaking Through,2008 Oscars Portfolio,,Breaking Through,,,,By LYNN HIRSCHBERG; Photographs by RYAN McGINLEY,"[{'firstname': 'Lynn', 'middlename': None, 'lastname': 'HIRSCHBERG', 'qualifier': None, 'title': None, 'role': 'reported', 'organization': '', 'rank': 1}]",,,,Alzheimer
